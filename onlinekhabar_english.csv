With the ongoing Nepal-India border seal, about 4,000 containers carrying consignments for Nepali traders are still stuck at the dry port at Sirsiya of Birgunj.
Every day, about three to four racks of goods are being imported to Nepal on the railway. However, since they are not being transported in trucks, it has resulted in a long queue of containers at the port.
An agent of the Customs Department at Sirsiya dry port, Anil Patel, says, “Unloading of goods from the train is prioritised. Once that is done, other trucks are loaded. For the last two days, we have not been able to load the trucks. Truck drivers are enduring the waiting time with biscuits and water.”
This has troubled the businesspersons a lot as they are waiting to get their goods to cross the border. Longer the wait at the border, its fees will be higher too. Also, they have to pay ‘detention and damage’ fees while the factories have also suffered irregular operation."

The People’s Socialist Party Nepal leader Surendra Yadav has submitted an application to the constitutional human rights watchdog, National Human Rights Commission, complaining two lawmakers of the ruling Nepal Communist Party and a former chief of Nepal Police tried to abduct him last week.
Yadav went to the commission after the police in Kathmandu and the Government Attorney Office did not register his application claiming the incident took place in Mahottari district and he should go to the district to file the complaint.
He met two NHRC members Prakash Wasti and Mohna Ansari and submitted his application. Responding to him, Wasti said the commission would investigate if Yadav’s claim was true. “If it was an abduction case, it is a violation of human rights. We will speak about restoring human rights.”
Yadav has been claiming that lawmakers Mahesh Basnet and Kisan Shrestha, and former IGP Sarbendra Khanal abducted him last week.
Earlier, it was reported that the three had forced Yadav to come to Kathmandu from his house in Mahottari district as the ruling party was arranging for the Samajwadi Party’s split. However, the Samajwadi Party merged with the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal on the same day to form the People’s Socialist Party Nepal.
The accused, however, have been insisting Yadav had agreed to come to Kathmandu to talk to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli."

The International Monetary Fund has said that the global economy has already been hit by a recession due to the lockdowns imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak. According to them, this recession will not only be worse than the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, but also the worst economic recession after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Recession Vs depression
When the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is low, we understand this state as an economic slowdown. We need to note that the growth rate is still positive in an economic slowdown. A recession is the state of the economy where a country is facing a negative growth rate for more than two consecutive quarters.  Depression is entirely a new ballgame altogether; it is the worst situation and it can be understood as a recession for a longer period. When a country witnesses minus 10 or even lower GDP growth rates for three years or more, we can understand that the country is going through a depression. Depression will have a lasting impact. In the last 150 years, the world has witnessed only one depression, the Great Depression of the 1030s, and it lasted for more than 10 years. At one point, the world’s GDP growth rate had touched minus 15%. The unemployment rate was 25-30% in most of the countries.
In the 2008 Financial Crisis, the worldwide GDP was down by just 1%, so it is largely understood as a Great Recession, not the Great Depression.
The World Trade Organisation’s chief Roberto Azevedo has said that economic downturn and job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic would be worse than the 2008 recession. The Bank of France has made a statement that France is in its worst performance since 1945 as its economy shrank by around 6% in the first quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic decimated business activities. This is the worst in history ever since World War II (1939-1945) and it has been anticipated that the second quarter will get even worse to minus 10%.
There are some factual differences between the 2008 Great Financial Recession (popularly termed as Financial Crisis) and the current pandemic. In the 2008 Financial Crisis, people were still going to work, the economy was moving though it was not in good health, which seems not happening currently.
Current scenario
In the global context including India, employers are either cutting on salaries or laying off people temporarily or permanently. Estimates released by the National Sample Survey (NSS) and Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS), suggested that over 136 million non-agricultural jobs are at immediate risk. Workers without formal employment contracts, casual labourers, those who work in small companies, and the self-employed are the most vulnerable. India has estimated 120 million migrant labourers, who work for daily wages, have borne the brunt of the crisis.
So far as aviation is concerned, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) noted that more than 2 million jobs are at risk only in India’s aviation sector and the case is no different in other countries.
The International Labor Organisation (ILO) has predicted that 38% of all employees in the world are either at the risk of layoff or salary cut. This gives a total number of more than 1 billion workers at the risk of layoff or pay cut. More than four out of five people in the global workforce are currently affected by full or partial workplace closures due to the Covid-19 outbreak. That is according to a new study from the UN’s International Labour Organisation (ILO), which says that about 2.7 billion of the 3.3 billion people in the workforce are currently unable to work as they usually would. It says the coronavirus crisis will lead to 6.7 per cent of all working hours globally being wiped out in the second quarter, equivalent to 195 million full-time workers.
Big companies might be better off in comparison to small businesses. They might still have the financial capability to sustain for some time with the hope of bouncing back, but small businesses are sure to face the wrath of an economic downturn.
Small businesses
Most of the small businesses might not have the capacity to bear losses for three to four months and the first move for them is to cut costs. Then, the only quick option left is to lay off their staff. This is quite evident in the Indian market already. Most of the migrant workers in India have been jobless and they do not have money to eat. The situation is so pathetic that they have now started to demand at least transportation so that they can move back to their villages.
Impact on global value chain (GVC)
The industrial production in China has fallen by 13.5% in January and February combined, compared with the previous year. This drop in the production is severe, in particular, when putting it into a longer perspective: neither the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003 nor the financial crisis in 2008/2009 was associated with any such stark drop in production. China has been a major exporter for almost all countries around the globe and this is pretty evident that the global value chain (GPCs) is going to cripple the economic activities.
Brighter side 
Albert Einstein says, “In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.” There will be enormous opportunities to leverage and those who see it are going to be winners.
Innovation
We might be able to see a lot of innovation in education sectors. Learning through a virtual platform is something very new to all of us and getting accustomed to it is no easy task since it takes time to accept changes and be comfortable with new normal.
Likewise, it is expected that technologies around online platforms are expected to get better only to provide a better experience to customers, and gradually, we can install this behaviour as business as usual (BAU).
A survey by EY.com has found that most of the executives and business leaders at the helm have already started to think about how they can speed up the automation process to stay in the game. Once the situation stabilises, executives around the globe will have to make faster moves to reimagine, reshape, and reinvent their business and create long term values. Not doing so would really be fatal to their businesses.
The most fascinating thing is every executive even with a primitive approach towards change is forced to explore alternatives as someone rightly said “Necessity is the mother of Invention” and this necessity is going to bring massive technological revolution in the days to come.
Let’s try to understand this. If you are running a business, I bet you have more than 10 thoughts in your mind and these all thoughts are around technology. You might be critically thinking and asking questions to yourself: How can I build solid technology for my business so that I can continue to stay in the game or rather become a winner. So, quite obviously, you will definitely do something. Entrepreneurs from around the globe will be focusing on technological disruptions in their respective fields. So this necessity will definitely bring a lot of inventions and this will build better lives for the entire human race.
Nepal
Unfortunately, due to the lack of data, we have very little visibility on how our economy is moving.
According to the Migration in Nepal report, there are an estimated 500,000 Nepali migrants in Malaysia, 400,000 in Qatar, 334,451 in Saudi Arabia, and 224,905 in the UAE. These four countries alone have 1.4 million-plus Nepali migrant workers. The Nepali population in India is close to 4 million. There are only speculations and assumptions, and we are sure to face some great challenges in the days to come.
Hopefully, with some government interventions as well as proactive initiatives from private sectors, we might be able to control the negative effects of the current situation. More than anything else, the need of the hour is to help businesses, especially small businesses, so that they can live until the storm passes.

The government of Nepal has started rescuing the Nepali citizens stranded across the Mahakali, the western frontier of the country, due to the lockdown.
In a meeting held on Wednesday, chief district officers of Baitadi and Darchula of Nepal and Pithoragarh of India had agreed to start the ‘rescue operation’ from today, informed Assistant Chief District Officer of Darchula, Tek Singh Kunwar.
The migrant workers who were returning home after the lockdown in India cost their jobs were barred from entering Nepal citing the lockdown here. They were not allowed to enter even after passing a month quarantined.
Locals had been pressuring the local representatives demanding the rescue at the earliest.
There are about 2,000 Nepalis stranded across the border."

The little mishap I had in the last ride prevented me, however, from riding for almost two weeks. Some 50 yards before the holy site, a dog suddenly attacked, and I took a nasty fall. My left elbow and my bruised knee hurt severely from the knock. I made it to the holy site, though.
My long experience has taught me not to attempt far-off remote places alone, and by no account, after dark, a rule of thumb every biker—a beginner or old hand—should follow. I broke the rule that day.
Flashback
On a ride to Kavresthali hills, I was sipping tea at a teashop at Sangla when I overheard a woman talking animatedly to the owner lady, about having seen the holy temple of Badrinath in Shantidham. I could not believe my ears. I had only known the Badrinath Dham located in Uttarakhand, India. “It is just four kilometres away from here,” she said. I could not wait to hop onto my saddle. Although a little late in the afternoon, I rode off, consumed with the thought of seeing the temple for myself.
Some half-hour later, at the arch sign: “Way to Shantidham.” The lady I met had asked me to take a better road one-half kilometre further down. But I kept on as I thought it would save time and be back home before dark. As I pedalled uphill, shortly, I had to get off my bike as the dirt track was too steep and badly washed out by past monsoon rains.

Soon I realised I was the only soul around. The track led uphill into woods with no sign of any habitation. As thick shrubs and the woods started, it suddenly occurred chances of wild animals from the Shivpuri National Park straying into them at dusk were not unlikely.
Sightings of both leopards, and at times black bears, were often reported in fringe areas of the park, including Kavresthali hills. Had it been daytime, not much to worry, but after dark, it was a different story.
In two minds
Shadows lengthened, signalling an approach of dusk. I began to waver, torn between two minds. One told me, to back out, the other kept goading me—no guts, no glory—I should not give up.   The dense woods got quieter as I dragged my bike uphill. Birds seemed to end their flurry to slowly turn-in, winding up their dusk chorus.
My restless mind started seeing things in darkened shrubs that looked menacing. The debate between my inner voices continued. Before long, darkness fell, and I switched on my lights. Except for my heavy breathing, and the bike’s dragging sound, the total hush felt spooky. I kept going, weary and edgy, though.
Soon, trees and underbrush seemed to play tricks on my eyes as the beam of light fell upon them. What was that? Did I hear a rustling in the nearby shrub? Perhaps, a leopard lurking in the undergrowth? My imagination ran riot.
Even the faint sound of a stream in the stillness felt too loud. Then a hoot of an owl tore through the silence. I froze. I was near panic when, suddenly, I saw an illumination some 50 yards ahead, on the darkened hill. Phew, hope at last!
Off to Shantidham
I had my old partner, Shayeet, accompany me the second ride to Shantidham. We chose the dirt road I had backtracked on my earlier trip. My elbow and knee still hurt a little despite the fortnight rest.
It barely took us half-hour from our residence at Milan Tole, Tokha Road, to Manmaiju heights. We then took a downhill that led to open fields with stubbles from cut paddy.
As we crossed a sullied stream, a strong stench filled our nostrils from pig and poultry farms spread out along the track. “Ugh, what disgusting smell,” cried out Shayeet.
Thati Chowk
A little later, we met a paved road that headed north. Shortly, we were at Thati Chowk, Pipalbot, Kavresthali. A huge pipal tree (Ficus religiosa) bounded by a Shiva temple stood in the middle of the road. A bit further, we stopped for tea at Sangam Chowk. Tea stalls and shops flanked the street.


After a refreshing cup of buffalo-milk-tea (my favourite) and a breather, we hit a dirt track. The country road ran across farmland with roadside houses. As lush-rolling hills rose in north, terraced fields gradually descended to the sprawling city core.
Every time I rode that route, the wayside seemed to roll up more houses, while trees and foliage receded. The countryside looked all set to make rapid inroads into urban sprawl. It was, though, gratifying to the eyes and the mind to see what little tilled land and lush foliage the countryside still held.
Ten minutes later, the dirt road headed down a slope to a copse of trees and met a fork. The left had an arch-gate that read: Shantidham Entrance, Welcome. The right went to Bihani Chowk. Next followed a gruelling incline.

Gurukul
We stopped by a temple called Shimleswor Mahadev to recover our breath and sip water from our bottle. Next to the shrine, we saw students from a Sanskrit academy, engaged in some game. They seemed curious to share some knowledge about their Gurukul (seminary) with us. Shayeet even had them grouped up for a photograph.

To our great displeasure, the climb did not let up for what seemed a lifetime. We but kept on stoically, both riding and walking our bikes. “Uncle, this uphill must be the toughest we have done together,” 19-year old Shayeet remarked.  As I reflected on that, I patted myself on the back and smiled because I was 67 and still going strong.
The road left behind houses and shops and entered the woods.  Suddenly, the place appeared familiar as I spotted the fork. Then it flashed on my mind the road that went down I had come last time.
Shortly, I noticed the house where the dog attacked me on my previous ride, and I crashed. I told Shayeet to be on guard as it might rush at us. To our great relief, there was no sign of the dog. Ten minutes later, we made it to Shantidham.

Shantidham
I had looked upon the internet the photographs of Badrinath Temple, located in Uttarakhand, India before we started. The temple was indeed a commendable work at replicating the authentic edifice from India.

As I looked closely, I noticed the temple building at Shantidham had red-tiled roof, whereas the picture on the internet showed Badrinath Temple from India with a gilded roof. Other disparities on the façade appeared insignificant.

Shantidham, however, included additional structures like the tall column that held on top idols of different deities. An annex provided living quarters for priests and the Swamiji, the founder of the holy establishment.

I noticed a raised pulpit in the forecourt for religious recitations from the Swamiji. The striking feature, as the name Shantidham suggested, was the tranquil surroundings bounded by tall mix trees including pine, and shrub jungle. As lush wooded hills rose in the northwest, the elevation afforded a view of distant mountains and the Kathmandu Valley.


An inscription on the column in the forecourt read, “Inaugurated in 2074 BS by the President, Mrs Bidya Devi Bhandari.” One of the pillars of the annex building caught my attention. It held a display-board that included names of financial donors to the establishment; some amounts crossed six figures.
Shortly, Shayeet and I entered the temple building to pay our homage. The main gate opened to a courtyard with verandahs on three sides. A red-tile three-tier pagoda-style tall minaret stood in the middle.  Idols of Jaya-Vijaya, the dwarpalakas (gatekeepers) to Lord Vishnu, flanked the doorway.
The main chamber housed a black granite idol of Lord Vishnu, festooned with ornate gold necklaces. I noticed one of them included a pendant shaped into an ‘Om’ symbol. An automated dholak (drum) used during the arati ritual sat at one corner.

As an intricate silver shade hung over the idol of Lord Vishnu, a gilded halo surrounded the bust. Lord Vishnu donned a jewelled crown holding a Sudarshan Chakra (a spinning disc used by the god as weapons) with the index finger of his right hand and a conch by his left.
Going by Hindu theology, Gods Rama and Krishna are considered the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu is also said to be part of the Hindu Trimurti (a triad of three gods), or the sacred ‘Hindu Trinity’ as Brahma, the Creator; Shiva, the Destroyer; and Vishnu, the Preserver. Photography inside the chamber was not allowed.

Swamiji
As I missed out on my last visit meeting the principal founder of Shantidham, Swamiji, Shri Chaturbhujacharya Chundamani Maharaji, I could not wait to see him. I hastened to ask the priest, Kumar Acharya, to arrange an audience with Swamiji.  Kumarji not only informed me the Swami was available but also obliged by arranging the meeting.
We did not have to wait long. In less than 10 minutes, a bearded man dressed in a saffron dhoti, a kameez, and a shawl, wrapped around his shoulder, looking in his early 30s, with long flowing locks and a big sandalwood tika on his forehead, appeared; that was Swamiji.
In response to my Namaste, he smiled back with folded hands and motioned us to the raised dais built for pravachans or preachings from Swamiji, and seated himself before a small desk. Before I could put a question, Swamiji broke into a chant and recited a Sanskrit shloka (verse). I waited patiently.
To my question what inspired him to set upon the formidable task of building the holy temple of Badrinath in Shantidham, the Swamiji appeared very composed: “During my stay in India, I came across many Nepali pilgrims travelling to Chardham, namely: Rameswaram, Jagannath Puri, Dwarka, and the Badrinath. Most of them included elderly people.”
“For them,” Swamiji continued, “Travelling hundreds of miles in India was extremely demanding. First, it involved a lot of expenses, not everyone could afford it; and secondly, travelling long distances by buses and trains in India for the Nepalis was arduous and hectic. A lot of people fell ill, especially the elderly.”
After a little pause, Swamiji added, “So, it just struck me if the Nepali devotees could pay their homage to those four holy places right here in Nepal, it would save them all the hassle, time and money.”
“With the blessings and divine favour of God and the support of the devotees, we have at this stage completed the first project, the Badrinath Temple. The future will have the rest of three dhams, too,” concluded Swamiji reciting a shloka.
Later, Swamiji shared with me his early days at Varanasi, India, where he studied Sanskrit and completed his Vidyavaridhi (PhD). He also taught at different Sanskrit colleges in India. He travelled extensively to a great many holy places in India before venturing out on this mission single-mindedly.
As Swamiji left the rostrum, I could not help admire his staunch dedication to embark upon the ambitious task for the cause of the Nepali devotees. He sounded confident and determined.
In hindsight                                                          
As we left, it crossed my mind, maybe, I’d not have made the second visit to Shantidham if I had backed off that day, or perhaps I mused amusingly, become a perfect dinner for the leopard lurking behind the shrubs. I kept wondering our way back home what drove me to it against my better judgment.
How to go?
First, go to Balaju Bypass (Machha Pokhari) and head for Nepaltar. At Nepaltar, after crossing a bridge close to an army barrack, take a left turn and head for Jarankhu. The road goes along the Sheshmati River (Mahadev Khola). After Jarankhu, go towards Sangam Chowk. After half a kilometre from Sangam Chowk towards Bihani Chowk, you will see an arch-gate to your left with a sign that reads Shantidham. Just follow the road. The distance to the Dham is three kilometres from Sangam Chowk.

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, apparently in his bid to delay the Nepal Communist Party’s unfavourable decision of making him resign from the premiership, has floated the name of the party’s vice-president Bamdev Gautam as the next prime minister.
He also proposed that the party induct former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal as another chairperson of the party which already has two chairpersons: himself and Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
Oli’s proposals come after Dahal and Nepal allied with each other to put pressure on Oli. As both of the leaders spoke against him during the secretariat meeting held last evening, Oli defended he should leave neither chairmanship or the premiership, claiming he was doing good jobs in both the roles.
Even if the party wants to change the prime minister, no any old face–Dahal, Nepal or Jhala Nath Khanal–should repeat, but Gautam should get a chance, he advised, adding the party could elect Bamdev Gautam into the National Assembly or the House of Representatives for this.
However, many including Gautam himself suspect that Oli’s proposal was not honest as efforts to make Gautam, who hold the parliamentary elections in 2017, have repeatedly failed. There is not the possibility of him being elected the House of Representatives member anywhere whereas the party does not have consensus about letting the National Assembly member become the PM."

Jaleshwar, April 29
After four persons of a locality died in the last two days in Bhangaha municipality-7 of Mahottarai, the locals here have been panicked.
The municipality’s ward 7 chairman Basudev Singh Tharu says fear has run high among the people after the deaths of four from Meghnath Gorahanna village of Bhangaha municipality-7.
The dead ones are Mohan Chaudhari, 40; Nathuni Chamar, 52; Lal Babu Singh, 54; and Ganga Ram Sada, 52.
Ward chairman Tharu, however, guesses they might have died with excessive intake of homemade liquor, and the liquor might be contaminated. SP Shyam Krishna Adhikari says it is difficult to ascertain the cause without postmortems.
Three bodies had been cremated before police reached the incident site.
The body of Lal Babu Singh was recovered for postmortem, he adds.

Kathmandu, April 29
The Central Bureau of Statistics has forecast that the country’s annual economic growth of this fiscal year will be as low as 2.27 per cent due to the impact of the global Covid-19 crisis.
In its national accounts statistics released on Thursday, the CBS projects that the growth rate of the gross domestic product will be just around one-fourth of the government target.
The estimate is based on the assumption that the hospitality and international travel and tourism sectors would be affected by the crisis throughout the year and other sectors would gradually resume operation after around 15 days, informs the CBS.
As per the estimate, the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the national economy will achieve a growth of 2.54 per cent, 3.36 per cent and 1.99 per cent respectively.
Earlier, the World Bank had projected that the country’s annual growth would be somewhere between 1.5 per cent and 2.8 per cent next fiscal year.

The Development and Technology Committee in Parliament has directed the governments to provide jobs to the Nepalis who are likely to return home from their foreign jobs in the wake of the global Covid-19 crisis.
A meeting of the committee on Thursday made the decision. Earlier, a few days ago, the government had estimated that around 300,000 migrant workers could return home after losing jobs due to the crisis. Thousands of Nepalis working in various parts of India have already returned home.
The committee also directed the government to provide some other facilities to such workers in a package, besides employment.
Meanwhile, the committee also urged the government to ensure that all the infrastructural construction works were ongoing even during the lockdown."

Fearful that the standing committee of his Nepal Communist Party will remove him from the position of the prime minister, KP Sharma Oli is preparing to convince the secretariat to call a parliamentary party instead, multiple sources inform.
Oli is preparing himself to face voting in the parliamentary party if the leaders continue voicing for his ouster, leaders close to him reveal, adding he has already begun counting the number of lawmakers in his support.
Though it was reported a few days ago that he was in minority in the parliamentary party, a few more lawmakers have extended support to him now, and if voting happens, he will win the vote of confidence as the parliamentary party leader. In that case, the opponents in the party cannot demand his ouster.
The party’s secretariat meeting has been scheduled for 5 pm today. It is highly likely that the dissatisfied leaders will press Oli for the standing committee meeting there.
But, ahead of that, Oli has already begun collecting the signatures of the lawmakers in his support. Oli is frequently meeting his party’s lawmakers for the past few days."

A central leader of the ruling Nepal Communist Party has said that the party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal is the only option available to the party to lead the government after the failure of KP Sharma Oli.
Sah’s statement comes at a time when Oli fears that a majority of the leaders in the party are planning to remove him from the party’s chairmanship, as well as the premiership. Whereas many believe that Madhav Kumar Nepal is the one to replace Oli in the leadership, Sah says Nepal is also not efficient enough.
The former minister, however, suggests that the top leaders of the party should make sincere efforts to unify the party instead of those to divide.
In a conversation with Onlinekhabar, Sah says whenever options are sought, Dahal should be given a chance as the two leaders had agreed to share the premiership equally whereas he is also in the second rank of the party after Oli."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

A woman has died after surviving repeated acts of torture from her husband in Khairahani of the Chitwan district of western Nepal.
DSP Narahari Adhikari, the spokesperson of the District Police Office, says Gita Majhi died during treatment at the Bharatpur Hospital on Monday night. Injured in the assault, she was admitted to the hospital on Thurasay. 
Reportedly, her husband Ram Chandra had put a stick into her anus on Thursday, seriously injuring her. 
The woman was operated on, on Monday, but she died at around 11 pm, according to the hospital’s Gopal Paudel. 
Police have arrested the husband for further investigation. They are preparing to file two cases against him under murder and rape laws."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Amidst escalating internal differences in the ruling Nepal Communist Party, the party’s chairman Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has called a meeting of the party secretariat on Wednesday evening.
After the government issued two controversial ordinances without consulting other leaders in the party last week, influential leaders of the party including the party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal have expressed their dissatisfaction with the Oli leadership. Twenty members of the party’s standing committee, apparently backed by the two leaders, have asked Oli to hold the standing committee meeting at the earliest.
Oli has been repeatedly consulting leaders close to him and those belonging to the disgruntled camp in his bid to regain the lost control over the party. He had called the secretariat meeting after consulting Dahal yesterday.
Oli fears many members of his party want to remove him either from the party’s chairmanship or the premiership or both. He is looking for ways to secure both the positions or at least one.
The meeting shall convene at the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar at 5 pm today. Earlier, the meeting was said to be held on Tuesday, but it was postponed as the leaders were busy in negotiations."

Interestingly, the use of mobile phones has been proved effective in providing information about the noble disease as almost all families have access to these little devices these days. All telecommunication service providers, as well as a few national and international enterprises, have also supported the government effort in the awareness drive.
Who is doing what? 
As an effort to raise public awareness about the disease, Nepal Telecom, the government-run telecommunications company, changed its usual caller ring back tone (CRBT) with a message about the Covid-19′ symptoms and certain precautions that the public can adopt in this situation. Nepal Telecom started this service from the afternoon of March 19, five days before the lockdown started, and is still in practice.

However, the message is not always the same. “Nepal Telecom has been changing the awareness CRBT as per the requirement of the situation. It has already been changed three or four times since the beginning,” Rajesh Joshi, the company’s spokesperson, says.
“The awareness message that comes from the Ministry of Health and Population to the company are recorded, kept into its system and catered via CRBT and SMS to the users,” he informs, adding, the decision to play the message as the CRBT, however, is the company’s own. “We felt it was our social responsibility to do something at the time of this crisis.”
Meanwhile, the company in collaboration with Viamo, a global social enterprise focused on “improving lives via mobile”, also added some other awareness messages into its information centre called ‘NT Suchana ko Sansar’.
Prabina Shrestha, the product manager at Viamo, explains, “One having an NT SIM card can access this service by making a call at 32100 for free as of now. They need to follow the voice instructions to get the information.”
Shrestha shares, “On the basis of the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Viamo prepared a script comprising the queries about the disease and their answers, such as about its symptoms and preventive measures in the English language. Then, we went to the National Health Education Information and Communication Centre (NHEICC) to take approval. After that, the awareness message was translated and recorded in the Nepali language by Digital Broadcast Initiative Equal Access and finally added to NT Suchana ko Sansar service.”
Kunj Prasad Joshi, a Senior Health Education Administrator at the NHEICC, confirms, “We check whether the contents given by the private organisations are according to the guidelines of the MoHP and then approve or reject their proposal accordingly.”
Just like the NT, another leading telecommunications service provider of the country, Ncell, has also started spreading awareness via CRBT, text messages, engagement promos, and outbound dialing (OBD) calls.
The company’s officials say the company has been continuously spreading awareness on the pandemic from March 3 as soon as it received a request from the Ministry of Health through the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the sector’s regulatory agency. By April 23, Ncell has sent over 45 million SMSes, 20 million OBD calls, and changed its ring back tone in line with the government’s messages.
In collaboration with the government’s Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre (CDMC), both Ncell and NT launched a self-assessment survey, through USSD code *17100# or IVR 17100 (for Ncell subscribers) and *1419# (for NTC subscribers), in which the respondents can answer a number of queries related to symptoms of the disease.
According to Ncell, its subscribers, after answering a series of questions related to symptoms of the disease also receive instant messages with suitable health advice including details of government hotlines such as 1115, 1133, 9851255839, 9851255837, 9851255834, and Ncell hotline number 9801575005. Ncell launched its hotline service in collaboration with a health service-providing company called ‘Health at Home’, in which one can consult doctors over the telephone for free.
Besides operating such hotlines, the government has not made any investment in such systems, according to Joshi of the NHEICC.
Assessing effectiveness
Though the companies are excited about sharing information on their initiatives, how effective these services have been to control the spread of the coronavirus is one of the prominent queries as of now.
In response to this query, Joshi of the NT answers, “We are receiving a lot of positive feedback from our users. We believe it is necessary to keep reminding people about the symptoms and preventive measures repeatedly so that they will follow them seriously.”
Likewise, Shrestha of Viamo shares, “Our efforts are mainly focused on the people of rural areas. Though we have not carried out any official survey about how effective this service has been to spread awareness about the coronavirus, we are hopeful that it has been effective to a certain extent.”
Similarly, according to Ncell, amongst all services, the OBD has been most persuasive to make people aware of the Covid-19."

Politically, the prime minister is an experienced captain. He is believed to be in the cockpit for a complete journey of five years. His long struggle for a prosperous democratic republic in the foothills of the Himalayas has made him more experienced, no doubts. But, any forceful taking-off or confused landing is always risky. We are the best witness of many political crashes in the country.
I wonder why Nepal needs a government with the two-thirds majority support. Why do we need a big council of ministers at the centre? What makes the prime minister feel insecure? From whose pocket do the names of the going-to-be ministers come out regularly?
Oli’s political growth model should neither be based fully on a communist or a non-communist manifesto. It should socialism-oriented with democratic control on it.
The Rostovian model of economic growth with a non-communist manifesto portrays five stages from a traditional society to a society of high mass consumption. We are still lacking in creating a pre-take-off condition, both politically and economically. A society of high mass consumption is our dream. Let us reach a stage of maturity first.
We have already taken part in the world economic race. Our membership in the WTO and SAFTA, our liberalised economy, and the entertainment of globalisation cannot give us the privilege to remain slow in any process of economic rivalry. But, economically and, of course, politically, we still do not have any idea how to walk. A child needs to learn how to walk to run and to walk, the child must be able to stand up.  We are trying to walk politically, but yet not making any remarkable effort to stand up economically.
We have limitations. The open market and liberalised economy, China’s cost-effectiveness in production, and Nepal’s quantitative consumption are the economic challenges. Our trade deficit with India is widening. Economists warn us about our economic growth and our export-import ratio. Nepal’s domestic product will not be able to compete nationally, regionally, and globally. Our democracy made multiple promises to us, but still, it lacks plans of action to increase productivity, create employment, and generate revenues. This is still a national challenge.
I wish, dear captain, please choose the perfect runway for your taking-off and the most suitable end for landing once you complete the flight for this crucial period of time. You have both ends open. Please decide the safest one. Be aware if you feel that you receive any bafflement from your control tower during your flee.  I wish my prime minister will be a perfect captain of Nepali politics. I read senior captain Bijay Lama, “There is no second chance for a pilot.” And I do support him.

The Kathmandu District Government Attorney Office has also refused to register a complaint against two lawmakers of the ruling Nepal Communist Party and a former chief of Nepal Police.
Earlier on Sunday, the Metropolitan Police Range in Kathmandu had also refused to register the complaint citing it would not fall under their jurisdiction.
Top leaders of the newly unified People’s Socialist Party Nepal pleaded with the chief of the Government Attorney Office, Hari Prasad Regmi, to register the complaint, but could not convince him even in two hours.
They had gone to the Babarmahal-based Government Attorney Office to file the complaint claiming lawmakers Mahesh Basnet and Kisan Shrestha, and former IGP Sarbendra Khanal abducted the party leader Surendra Yadav last week.
Earlier, it was reported that the three had forced Yadav to come to Kathmandu from his house in Mahottari district as the ruling party was arranging for the Samajwadi Party’s split. However, the Samajwadi Party merged with the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal on the same day to form the People’s Socialist Party Nepal.
The accused, however, have been insisting Yadav had agreed to come to Kathmandu to talk to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli."

A day after the government-run Radio Nepal broadcast a live interview of opposition leader Baburam Bhattarai, in which he criticised Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in strong words, the government had sought a clarification from the station’s chief.
The government’s move is highly likely to draw further criticism against it.
Over the issue, the station’s executive director Suresh Kumar Karki had apologised to the government publicly, removing the interview from the station’s website. Many stakeholders of the sector and the public had considered his submissiveness as a move against press freedom.
A day after that, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology wrote to Karki to submit his explanation in the next three days. The letter states that the communications minister decided to seek his clarification."

“We are not in operation for now. We are not shut down; we will be starting again. But, this may take some time even after the lockdown ends,” Sherpa, a cofounder of the shoe customisation company, says, “As of now, we have stopped taking orders and have requested our customers to wait till we are instructed to do business in a safe manner.”
The Covid-19 pandemic has halted the movement of the whole world. From an individual’s daily home-to-workplace routine to the government’s functioning, all have been directly or indirectly affected by this catastrophe.
This unprecedented pandemic and the resultant lockdown have impacted all kinds of businesses, but startups are worst hit, claim some startup runners including Sherpa claiming they are more vulnerable to recent changes in the market situation.
Whereas a few of the startups might be thriving due to their nature of focusing on emergencies, most have changed their regular operation model to sustain and some of them have completely shut down their business activity for now.
Big blow
Sherpa explains that his company has been severely affected by the lockdown as the international supply chain has been obstructed.  “We order our accessories mainly from the USA, and the lockdown in various countries has affected the supply of our goods. There are many people like us”
Likewise, Dulwa, a web-based travel information centre, has also halted its regular business amidst the lockdown. Nipun Shakya, the founder of the startup, says, “Business-wise, during the lockdown, our revenue is zero. Being a tourist information centre, with zero mobility of people in and out of the country, our routine work has been completely shut as of now.”
Nevertheless, he informs that Dulwa, in collaboration with different donors, is actively working to serve humanity during this hard time by distributing various relief packages to the needy ones following all the precautions and the rules stated by the government.
Transformation
In adapting to the new challenges, some startups have changed the way they work. Kokroma, a startup that manufactures and sells baby clothes, has adopted the work-from-home practice to sustain during this pandemic. Rewati Gurung, the company’s founder, shares, “It was completely shut down for the first two weeks. Since Kokroma is situated on the ground floor of my home and our tailors also live in the same neighbourhood, we came up with the idea to work from home. They pick up the cut cloth from the office and take it to sew at home and deliver completed products every few days.”
She stresses, “We are still able to function because all our raw materials are locally produced, and we do not rely on imports except for a few items like zippers or buttons.”
Likewise, Offering Happiness, a surprise event, and gift planning company, has come up with flexible business models to sustain during this crisis. Santosh Pandey, a cofounder of the startup, describes, “We stopped our delivery service for a while, preparing for safety and evolving our business model. Our whole team is working from home.”
According to Pandey, the company has also started delivering bakery items and essential goods as well considering the changed needs of the customers. “We have tried our best to go lean as much as possible so that we will have a good runway ahead.”
Support for employees 
As most of the businesses are closed these days, there is a heated debate regarding the employees’ pay. Even the so-called stable and bigger companies are finding it difficult to pay their staff’s full salary on time. For startups, apparently, it is much more difficult to support their staffers when the economic activities of the companies are completely shut.
Defying this belief, however, startups like Kokroma and Offering Happiness claim they have set an example. Gurung informs, “At the beginning of the lockdown, we paid our staff two weeks’ full salary even when there was no work. Now, as they are working from home, they are fully employed. Our staff were given important information regarding social distancing and hygiene at the start of the lockdown. They have been working full time at home since with no loss of income.”
Similarly, Pandey shares, “We are paying a regular salary to our team. We are proactively taking daily temperature readings of all our delivery personnel and ground staff. Our delivery personnel also wear PPE suits, masks, gloves, and are taking all safety measures before, during, and after deliveries.”
Meanwhile, Dulwa’s salary payment system has changed for now from monthly to hourly basis as there is no source of income for the company as of now. Shakya confirms, “Now, we are paying our staff on the basis of online working hours. Also, we have managed one-month food packages for our staff and their family.”
Adapting to the crisis
It is believed that moulding the products and the services as per the demand and necessity of the time and market is the key to success in the business. Corroborating to this belief, Kokrama’s owner asserts, “We changed our products according to the needs of the market. We started making face masks that are reusable with the cotton weaved by prisoners. The response is overwhelming.”
Gurung says the company distributed them to many old-age homes and child homes, as well as monasteries, in the Kathmandu Valley with the help of various sponsors. This helped us manage our finances during the Covid-19 situation, and keep our staff employed.”
Like Kokroma, Offering Happiness also has developed a flexible business model incorporating e-gifts and introducing essential goody delivery operations during this uncertain period.
Though regular business activities of the startups have been more or less impacted by this pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, all of them are hopeful of bouncing back even stronger post-lockdown."

Former government secretary Bhim Upadhyaya has said that he would not change the way he has been expressing his opinions on social media though he was arrested and prosecuted for that recently.
In an interview with Onlinekhabar after he was released on bail of Rs 25,000 following a court order, the outspoken critic of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his government urged the prime minister to change his way of handling various issues of public concern instead.
“This is my style. It will continue,” he says, “I am not required to correct myself, the prime minister should. I will continue writing on social media by adding some flavours to what journalists report.”
Earlier last week, police had arrested him from his Lalitpur-based house on the charge of writing various derogatory remarks against the prime minister which amounted to cybercrime.
The former bureaucrat accepts that he has been sarcastic about the prime minister and government because it is a citizen’s duty to scrutinise how the government and public office bearers work.
“The public office holders should have a capacity to tolerate harsh criticism; otherwise, we watch them,” Upadhyaya states, “They cannot be paid for nothing; they should show their competence for every penny they get from the state.”
Referring to a recent remark of Oli about the coronavirus infection, which has been proved false, he says the public office bearers like the prime minister should not say publicly whatever they like because they invite criticism."

The Tribhuvan International Airport General Manager Devendra KC says the existing departure hall is being demolished currently after the construction of the new one. He says space, where the hall was there in the past, will be used in parking and other purposes.
Meanwhile, works are also underway to expand the runway. The airport administration hopes that the new construction works will help the airport manage the aircraft effectively after it reopens.
“We have been utilising the lockdown as much as possible,” KC claims.

Owing to complaints that some local authorities have failed to implement restrictive measures imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country during the nationwide lockdown, the Ministry of Home Affairs has directed district administration offices across the country to strictly implement the restrictions.
After many local governments began to ferrying their residents from major cities including Kathmandu, the ministry has directed the authorities to completely stop the movement of vehicles that have not obtained permits to ply during the lockdown.
“They do not need permits for emergency purposes, but others cannot operate their vehicles,” the ministry’s spokesperson Kedar Nath Sharma says, “We had already issued a circular in this regard. But since there were complaints, we have reminded the authorities again.”
Accordingly, local police personnel have begun taking action against those defying the restrictive orders.
The government on Sunday had decided to extend the lockdown by 10 days."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

All cinema halls of the country are shut for around 40 days due to the coronavirus crisis. The industry has already lost millions of rupees, and they fear that it might take many years to recover the loss.
Around one week before the lockdown was announced, the government had decided to shut all entertainment centres such as cinema halls to avoid the crowds. Then, the closure was announced to be effective till April 30. However, since the lockdown has been extended until the first week of May and the government is likely to maintain distancing and other restrictions, the cinema halls are unlikely to open anytime soon.
Currently, there are around 200 cinema halls in the country. Around 60 per cent of them are single theatres whereas others are multiplexes. Of late, the investment in multiplexes is increasing in Kathmandu. Many of the single theatres are developing themselves in multiplexes.
Therefore, the entreprneurs are yet to assess the amount of the loss.
Madhu Sudan Pradhan, the president of an association of Nepali cinema hall operators, says a cinema hall’s monthly expense ranges between Rs 700,000 and Rs 4 million. He demands that the government make some initiatives to recover the loss.
The association has recently submitted a memorandum to Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada in this regard. “We have also appealed to the Film Development Board and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Also,” he says."

Mukta Devi, who became a mother a fortnight ago, has been going to bed hungry every night.
Similarly, Rajani Devi Sada, a member of the community, says the people of Bhaluwaha are yet to receive any relief support initiated by the municipality. She says the people are surviving on the insects they collect from the riverbanks. “There are around 10 pregnant women in our community now,” she says, “They are all dependent on the insects for nutrition.”
Jivachhi Devi Das of Dhanusha’s Bisanbhora, Sahid municipality-8, returned home 15 days ago after giving birth at the provincial hospital in Janakpur. She has not received adequate nutritious food. Her mother-in-law Ashadevi says that she was saving her pregnant daughter-in-law by asking for food materials from neighbourhood. No relief team has reached Bisanbhora yet.
The government data shows that 48 per cent of the people in Province 2 are living with ‘multidimensional poverty’. Most of the Dalits and Muslims, who make up around 70 per cent of the population, are living with poverty. There is an immediate need of relief in almost all of these communities.
The worsening condition of the poor
In Province 2, most of the new mothers have not been able to get enough to eat. They have complained that food materials distributed by the provincial and local governments have not reached the impoverished settlements. Pregnant women needing nutritious food have not been able to eat normal food supplements. Adequate milk and vaccinations for newborns have not been provided.
According to experts, the lack of nutritious food and vaccines is one of the main causes of maternal and infant mortality. Children who have grown up with a lack of nutrition and vaccines are more likely to have anemia and disability. Province 2 is still the second most malnourished region in Nepal after Karnali. According to government data, 59 per cent of children between the ages of six months and 59 months are anemic.
Similarly, 58 per cent of women aged 15-49 years have anemia and 36.8 per cent of children have low birth weight. The worse can be feared for the marginalised community as the condition of malnutrition will automatically increase if proper care is not given to the baby born during the lockdown and nutritious food is not provided to the pregnant and child up to five years of age.
The Secretary at the Provincial Ministry of Social Development, Ram Prasad Ghimire, says while fighting against Covid-19, attention could not be given on the new mothers in the marginalised areas. He says, “Even though attention has been paid to the quarantine sites and women coming to the hospitals, no attention has been paid to those of the communities.”
Malnutrition vulnerability spiking: Public health experts
The ongoing lockdown in Nepal has the left wage earners and the extremely poor in a state of famine. Public health expert Raj Kumar Mahato says pregnant women, newly mothers, and children under the age of five are at a high risk of malnutrition.
He is of the opinion that the lockdown adopted to avoid one pandemic has increased the risk of other epidemics such as hunger and malnutrition. He says that this situation came about due to the inability to manage the food materials required during the lockdown. “For this, the government at all three levels has to make the relief distribution very effective,” says Mahato."

Police in Kathmandu have refused to register a complaint against two lawmakers of the ruling Nepal Communist Party and a former chief of Nepal Police.
Top leaders of the newly unified People’s Socialist Party Nepal had gone to the Teku-based Metropolitan Police Range to file the complaint claiming lawmakers Mahesh Basnet and Kisan Shrestha, and former IGP Sarbendra Khanal abducted the party leader Surendra Yadav last week.
Earlier, it was reported that the three had forced Yadav to come to Kathmandu from his house in Mahottari district as the ruling party was arranging for the Samajwadi Party’s split. However, the Samajwadi Party merged with the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal on the same day to form the People’s Socialist Party Nepal.
The accused, however, have been insisting Yadav had agreed to come to Kathmandu to talk to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.
Responding to the leaders, police officers said the complaint should be filed in Mahottari district itself as the incident took place there.
Following that, the party’s leader Baburam Bhattarai said it was another example of the state’s criminalisation.

The maximum temperature in Kathmandu was recorded at 24.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday. This is around 3 degrees colder than this day last year. According to the records of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, the maximum temperature was measured at around 27 degrees Celsius on April 25, 2019.
According to senior meteorologist Mani Ratna Shakya, the temperature has dropped due to the pre-monsoon rains. He says that the snowfall along with the rain has also forced the mercury to plummet.
Meteorologists believe that the closure of factories and businesses due to the lockdown has minimal impact on the temperature change.
Kathmandu had 5 mm of rain on Saturday. When it rains, the level of humidity in the air increases.
According to climate analyst Ngamindra Dahal, cold winds continue even in the pre-monsoon. “At this time, the wind is blowing from the north-west to the south,” Dahal says, “It is the same wind that has made Kathmandu feel cold.”
In Nepal, the monsoon usually starts from mid-June every year, but the monsoon rains are warmer.
Adequate rainfall in pre-monsoon
According to the report of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum, there will be normal rainfall in the pre-monsoon this year.

Introduction
The history of Nepali academia has been largely dominated by the traditional pedagogical style based on territorialisation at the academies, schools, and universities, but today’s globalised world is moving towards the de/reterritorialisation of the academia, advancing the knowledge production model of pedagogical style. Through the use of advanced technology, the pedagogy of the academia has been totally democratised, deterritorialising the conventionally established physical territory essentialised for the pedagogical motive. The undeveloped countries like Nepal belong to the old epoch of territorialised conceptions of pedagogy though it is essential to deterritorialise the territorialised academia and reterritorialise it to move together with the speedily advancing world.
The terms ‘territorialisation’, ‘deterritorialisation’, and ‘reterritorialisation’ have been first used by French Marxist-psychoanalysts Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) and Félix Guattari (1930-1992) in their philosophical book Capitalism and Schisophrenia (1972–1980) to disrupt the predominant, authoritarian notions of identity, meaning, and truth, deterritorialising the Freudian and Lacanian territorialisation of human sexual organs. Territorialisation is the process of valourising certain organs and objects at the expense of others; deterritorialisation is the process of freeing desire from established organs and objects; reterritorialisation is a dream which reconstructs our suppressed desire of the unconscious reattaching into the new mode of production. In the same spotlight, through online learning systems, the traditionally territorialised learning can be deterritorialised and the whole academia can be reterritorialised in the virtually digitalised world. Though the developed and developing countries have already advanced the academia, entering the internet world, the undeveloped countries like Nepal,  due to their poor academic structure and consciousness, are still continuing the traditional territorialised world of academia. But, fortunately, or unfortunately, the pandemic Covid -19 prevalent in the world, has forced the countries to lock down which has opened up the consciousness to the online academia.

Territorialisation, deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation  

Territorialisation, in the academic world, refers to the system of following conventionally established physical locations as the formal pedagogical sites. The teaching-learning activities and the knowledge related programmes are limited only to the universities, colleges, schools, and the academies demanding complete physical presence of both the instructors and the learners. In such a system, there are three compulsory entities–teachers, students, and classrooms. In the classrooms, the students passively receive the lectures delivered by the teachers. There is a hierarchy of superior and inferior, giver and taker, and producer and receiver. The teaching-learning activity is largely dominated by and oriented towards the teachers rather than the learners. The students do not get any chance to fully, creatively, and critically participate in academic activities.
Such a traditional territorialised approach of learning ca not meet the goal set by the educational world and the governments.
Deterritorialisation, in academia, refers to a breakaway from the conventionally established educational system of obligating the physical universities, colleges, classrooms, and the face-to-face presence of both instructors and the learners. The long-time-back-established system has spread its roots everywhere so powerfully that it is very difficult to dismantle it and adopt a totally new system. Instead of going to the university and the classroom, both sides should participate in virtual classrooms to technology to adopt the new system. A lack of technological competence prevents both sides to conduct online educational classes; it makes the mission of e-learning a failure.
The physical territories, we believe, not only provide space for the teaching-learning activities but also create long-lasting memories assisting the academic activities. Moreover, the concept is deeply rooted within both sides that face-to-face meetings and interactions naturalise the learning. It effectively stops us from entering the advanced e-learning, and, secondly, causes us to return to the old one, feeling that the new one is difficult to assimilate. Therefore, one needs to dare to destabilise the old one and establish the new one with full effort.
Learning in de/reterritorialised academia

Internet learning (e-learning) offers conceptual and experimental learning through machines, media platforms, and network solutions in the de/reterritorialised academia. It takes place both inside and outside the classrooms. E-learning solutions consist of both instructor-led learning tools as well as self-paced platforms. This kind of learning has gained tremendous importance because of several competitive advantages in a number of areas like accessibility, inclusiveness, flexibility, technology, and convenience.
Today, e-learning tools and technologies cover simple home-based learning programmes, pre-recorded audio and video study tools, recorded video lectures, live streaming of classroom teachings, classroom aids, and multimedia-based learning, mobile learning, personalised online tutoring, e-learning authoring tools and e-books, online homework help services, online writing assistance, and editing services as well as far more sophisticated education technologies and e-learning solutions including technology-enhanced aids, augmented learning spaces, virtual reality-based corporate e-learning tools, online training software, online IT training and certification programmes. The study content of various grades can be easily accessed by the student in the format of e-books, online study guides, and stepwise solution manuals, e-mail exchange with online tutors, live chat with online tutors, downloadable videos, pre-recorded lectures, audio study guides and pre-loaded content on controlled tablet devices. Various education technology providers are also heading towards mobile learning solutions (also known as m-learning) as the advanced stage of education technology in the future.
Advantages of learning in de/reterritorialised academia
Disadvantages of learning in de/reterritorialised academia
Though there are some disadvantages of reterritorialising academia, the advantages outnumber them. Therefore, Nepal must begin it to exist together with the globalised and technologically advanced world. It is already late, but still, the initiation right now may preclude us from being a relic.
Right time
Now is the right time for Nepal to disrupt the conventional territory and adopt the new territory of the technology. It is the appropriate time to shift from place to space, physical to virtual, and physical face-to-face to digital face-face-to face academic arena. The Covid -19, though certainly a crisis to the human world, can surely help Nepal deterritorialise the academia and reterrritorialise it connecting everyone to the internet world.
Reterritorialisation is the process of dismantling the conventionally established physical universities and classrooms and establishing digital ones with the help of advanced technology. It is a new techno-friendly system of pedagogical style in the academic world. Moreover, it is the restructuring of the whole academia connecting people from every corner of the world into the learning process, establishing the virtual universities and classrooms. The online learning (e-learning) is a new form of study in which learning is possible remaining in comfort at home. It is reterritorialisation that provides an opportunity to remove the knowledge transference model and highlight the knowledge production model of pedagogy. Furthermore, it helps in democratisation of the learning systems and structures.
Nepal, a conventional pedagogy-following nation, has got the right time to initiate the online classes in the universities, colleges, and schools, strengthening the technological resources and skills, because the whole nation is locked down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Because of the long lockdown, the academic schedules have been deferred and we fear that the whole semester or year may be lost.
Though our nation as a whole, all institutions, and people, do not have access to internet technology, this time can be the first step to enter the digital learning world. All universities, colleges, and even schools should rightly launch the online learning system, which really makes the educational practices convenient opening the way to a new epoch.
The hitherto achieved experiences from both teachers’ and the students’ sides make us realise that online learning and virtual universities are really essential. The world has become highly capitalistic that time has become the greatest resource among all. Online education effectively saves time. Further, the digital connection blurs all the hierarchies related to age, class, caste, age, and region. Furthermore, the natural calamities and the pandemics like the current one prevent the physical university education. Therefore, it is the right time even for Nepal to deterritorialise the physical universities and classrooms and reterritorialise them in the digital world.

The government of Nepal says some people quarantined in different parts of the country to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country have tested positive for malaria.
Speaking in his daily press briefing on Saturday afternoon, the spokesperson at the Ministry of Health and Population, Bikas Devkota said the government was concerned about their health. He, however, did not reveal details of the malaria-infected patients including how many of them are affected in which specific places.
He said the concerned authorities should enhance the standard of quarantine sites to protect them from all such diseases."

Gandaki Chief Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung has demanded that the government resume construction and production works although the lockdown is extended again.
Gurung telephoned the coordinator of the high-level committee to control the coronavirus outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokharel, on Saturday and extended his suggestion.
“We will mobilise construction workers following code of conduct. We have also prepared a guideline to import and manage construction materials,” Gurung reportedly told Pokharel, “Likewise, the factories manufacturing foodstuffs should be opened. We should import the essentials by controlling the risk of infection.”
He urged the federal government to strictly monitor the border movement assuring the provincial governments were competent enough to take necessary precautions in their jurisdictions. He claimed that his province was a green zone now as both the Covid-19 patients there have achieved recovery now.
According to Gurung, the lockdown restrictions should be relaxed in safer areas though the nationwide lockdown gets extended."

The high-level committee to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country has concluded that the outbreak is still under control due to the lockdown imposed since March 24.
Citing the number of cases in all the places except in Udayapur is relatively low, the committee views the lockdown has been effective. Consequently, the committee has recommended that the government extend it further, a minister, who is also a member of the committee, informs.
Therefore, it is very likely that the government will extend the lockdown in its next meeting either on Sunday or Monday.
The lockdown, extended for the last time, is in effect till Monday.
Earlier on Friday, the cabinet had directed the high-level committee to discuss whether to extend the lockdown and make a recommendation to the government.
“We are on the right track,” Narayan Bidari, a secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister, who is also a member of the committee says, “But we also need to consider the situation of neighbouring countries. Now, the council of ministers will decide whether to extend it and if yes, how long.”"

A group of students of the Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur of Kathmandu has said some of its members were beaten up by unidentified locals in the town on Saturday morning.
The group says the members had gone to the local police station today demanding that they are provided security and relief support during the lockdown. However, a group of local youth assaulted them on the street, according to the leader of the group, Rup Narayan Shrestha.
During the clash, one named Lalit Jung Rawat has been injured and he has been rushed to a nearby hospital.
DSP Chhedi Lal Kamati, the chief of the Kathmandu Metropolitan Police Circle in Kirtipur, says two groups of youth had come to the streets defying the lockdown and they fought against each other. The situation was soon taken under control, according to him."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."
"
The government has decided to extend the ongoing suspension of domestic and international flights until May 15. Earlier, the suspension introduced to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country was in effect till April 30.
The high-level committee for the coronavirus control led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokharel made the decision on Saturday afternoon.
Narayan Bidari, a secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, says the meeting concluded that the suspension should not end on April 30 as decided earlier to avoid the risk."

Estimating that more than one million people in the country will lose their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government is preparing to prioritise employment generation in its annual budget plan for the next fiscal year.
As per the constitutional provision, the government will have to present the plan for the new fiscal year beginning mid-July, in Parliament on May 28. Officials in the Ministry of Finance have already begun preparations to draft the plan.
Whereas the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was focused on employment generation to provide social protection to the underprivileged in the past years, the officials there have now begun devising new concepts to address the current crisis.
This time, the government also has to address concerns of thousands of Nepalis who are likely to return home from various countries as they will lose their jobs due to the crisis. Recently, the government has estimated that around 300,000 Nepali migrants will return home soon."

Sitaula, who had played an instrumental role in drafting the 2015 constitution, has recently spoken to Onlinekhabar about recent political situations.
Excerpts:
What is your opinion about the ordinances brought by the government? Why did the Nepali Congress oppose them?
The whole country is fighting against the coronavirus epidemic. All businesses of the Nepali people are closed. It is not possible to hold even a small gathering. The social and economic condition of the country is becoming more and more critical day by day. The two ordinances that came by deceiving Parliament when the nation was in such a difficult situation are contrary to the spirit and emotion of the constitution.
What is even more serious to me is that at this time, it is the responsibility of the prime minister to unite the whole country. The decision of issuing these ordinances has hurt the hearts of many democrats among the political parties, in civil society.
Therefore, no one can support these current ordinances from the constitutional point of view and from the political point of view.
However, the prime minister argued that the Constitutional Council Ordinance was necessary and brought because the main opposition leader did not let the council work.
The functions, duties, and rights of the Constitutional Council as mentioned in the constitution demand consensus. The provision of having heads of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, the leader of the main opposition party, and even the head of the judiciary is a system that represents not only one government, but the entire state.
The ordinance of the Constitutional Council has been brought in such a way that the Constitutional Council does not represent the state, but only the prime minister. Therefore, an attempt was made to bring the Constitutional Council under the prime minister. This was very wrong; this was not the spirit of the constitution.
The spirit of the constitution is that the whole of parliament, the government, and the judiciary should work together.
The Prime Minister has been complaining for a long time that the officials of the constitutional bodies could not be appointed due to the non-cooperation of the opposition leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, due to the provision of consensus. Has the opposition leader troubled the PM?
I don’t think so at all. The prime minister convenes the meeting and others join.  When did such an incident take place? When did not the opposition leader go to the meeting? The prime minister has not said that clearly.
We do not have any policy of non-cooperation. We want the Constitutional Council to make decisions in consensus. Even if there was no consensus, the decision could have been taken by a majority.
The success of the prime minister is to unite the Constitutional Council and appoint the office bearers of the constitutional bodies. The heads and members of the constitutional bodies should represent the whole state, not the prime minister.
However, the prime minister has accused the opposition, Nepali Congress, of not cooperating in the appointment of the heads and members of the constitutional bodies…
This is very wrong. Even just a few days back, the Nepali Congress had invited and had discussions with the Samajwadi Party, the RJPN, and the RPP at our party office. All the leaders and friends of other parties had also come. Why is there a need for a law to split any party at this time? The prime minister should be sincere that his party should be united and the opposition parties should also be united. We have to think that even small parties should also stay united.
The unity of political parties gives political stability. The division of political parties pushes the country towards instability. The government itself is trying to create instability now.
Another issue is: why did he violate the constitution in the law related to the Constitutional Council? Why did he make such a mistake? Why did he bring such a serious issue from the ordinance? Why is he in such a hurry? Why was the enacted done within an hour without even keeping it in the Office of the President for a day?
You have been close to Prime Minister KP Oli. You also represent the same district. How does he think of or plan such decisions? 
It is not only that we represent one district, but in the entire national politics, we sat together and made the constitution. We also started people’s movement together. I am also a person who has been involved in the peace process. Oliji was the deputy prime minister in Girija Prasad Koirala’s cabinet and I was the home minister. We have a long association.
I am a well-wisher of KP Oli. But looking at his work, none of our good wishes are coming true. We want this government to succeed in the sense that it strengthens the constitutional order. Do enough work in the interest of the nation. Let the country be united.
Now that the country is fighting against the coronavirus. The prime minister can lead the way in uniting all political parties, civil society, and the nation as a whole. This is what we want. But, he added another great political tragedy while the people were in such a great tragedy. This political virus was added here at the time when the entire nation had to unite and fight against the coronavirus. This was a political virus over democracy. We are very concerned about this.
We have always wished the government best of luck in working for the benefit of Nepal and the Nepali people by uniting the entire nation in every aspect. But today, we are very sad. We are deeply saddened by the government’s efforts to tear apart national politics.
Let’s talk about the coronavirus instead of the political virus. How is the Nepali Congress looking at the steps taken by the government against the epidemic?
I can see that the people who have come to Kathmandu from outside the valley to work here are having a hard time now. Many people are walking away from here for 10 days. The government should be able to look after the very poor.
If people want to go to their homes outside Kathmandu, arrangements should be made to reach their homes. They should be able to get their health checked at the local level.
In addition, there have been complaints that the central, provincial, and local governments have not been impartial in distributing relief materials. Complaints have come from all quarters that it was not enough and it was not fair. The government should pay serious attention to this. By including all the political parties at the local level, the workers, small peasants, and poor people should be taken care of without any bias. Those who do not have food at home, do not have the opportunity to work for a daily wage, should be able to pay attention to them.
Third, health workers have complained that there are not enough kits available for testing, and not enough PPE sets. The government should pay serious attention to ensure that quality materials are delivered to every government hospital and the coronavirus tests get expanded as a campaign.
Similarly, many Nepalis have come to the Indian border and are stuck on the other side. We should be able to bring them back to their homeland, set up a quarantine site in their municipalities and keep them for 14 days, and arrange for them to reach their homes after undergoing a health check-up. The government should be able to pay attention to this as well.
Today, I would like to urge the government to perform at its highest level. Number one, especially in the field of health examination. Number two, in the field of quality materials provided to health workers.
Patients suffering from diseases other than Covid-19 are no longer being treated in hospitals. The government needs to pay attention to this as well. Many private hospitals are now on the verge of closure. Doctors and nurses are afraid to examine the patients, and the government needs to pay serious attention to this.
What I want to say is that the government should not think that the only solution lasts long. The government should start thinking of alternative solutions from today itself.
It has become clear that the coronavirus epidemic will have a negative impact on the world economy and politics. This affects Nepal. It is having a far-reaching negative impact on Nepal’s economy. Industries, factories, and hotels are closed. The tourism business is completely closed. The government should be able to take up special rescue and relief programmes for the entrepreneurs on these overall issues. In this regard, the government should be able to manage additional funds. For this, the government should unite the entire nation, uniting the entire parliament, and all the political parties. I think it is necessary to bring in a relief budget of around Rs 2 trillion to save the economy as a whole.
Democracy is a matter of concern to the general Nepali people. It is a matter of their prosperity. Therefore, we should work for the prosperity of the general Nepali people without any bias. He should be able to work in the interest of the general Nepali people by uniting the entire nation.
There are also allegations that the government has become arbitrary due to the weak role of the main opposition, Nepali Congress.
Especially in the days during the coronavirus epidemic, we have tried to go together. However, looking at the activities of the government, it is time to start a movement right now because of these two ordinances.
The country is in lockdown. How do you think that parliament can function smoothly during this time? What is your suggestion to the speaker?
At this time, there should not be any majority-minority division in parliament; it should be united. And, we should not deceive parliament. We should make arrangements for the next session. However, there should be provisions of regular health checkups of the lawmakers."

Stakeholders in Province 2 have commented that the province is not well-prepared to combat the Covid-19 outbreak in the region although a few cases have already been confirmed.
They say there are not sufficient hospitals, medical personnel, and equipment. Some government-run district hospitals are constructing new buildings whereas private hospitals have not launched any preparations to respond to the emergency situation.
The federal government has assigned the provincial hospital in Janakpurdham and Narayani Sub-regional Hospital in Birgunj to take care of the Covid-19 patients. The Birgunj-based facility already started hosting the Covid-19 patients whereas the Janakpur hospital is not prepared yet. Consequently, all five Covid-19 patients in the province are undergoing treatment in Birgunj currently.
The Janakpur hospital has started PCR tests for the coronavirus, but the samples are being sent to Kathmandu for verification.
Earlier, the provincial government had announced that Kalaiya Hospital in Bara and Jaleshwar Hospital in Mahottari would be developed as Covid-19-dedicated hospitals, but the plan is yet to materialise. There is not even an isolation ward in Kalaiya. The hospital management team and the provincial government are at odds over some managerial issues.
Likewise, Jaleshwar Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Rajeev Jha says his institution is reeling under a shortage of workforce and materials to develop into a Covid-19 hospital."

Meanwhile, many foreign governments have evacuated their citizens stranded in Nepal over the past few weeks considering the problems they are likely to face in the locked-down country.
At the same time, many are staying put wherever they are and living their lives as the new normal, and this also includes some members of the expat community living in Nepal. Continents away from their home and families, many are continuing to live their lives in solitude even after a month since the beginning of the lockdown. But, by no means, they say they are suffering.
Living in Nepal
One of them is Kennath Sandalls. “Nepal is like my second home. I came to Nepal last September to travel. After the lockdown, I have been self-isolating myself in a hostel,” he says, “But I have enough opportunities to socialise now also. I am not bothered by the lockdown as I am used to it. I have a great company of my good collection of music, which makes it easier for me. I also have a lot of friends here, who are protective of me and I am in constant touch with them. And I love the food (daal bhaat) here, so I have had no complaints so far.”
Like him, William Gary Rutley Wornell also feels satisfied with his stay in Kathmandu. “I feel I am lucky to be able to stay here and without a problem. I work as a designer and I work mostly from home for books and videos. It keeps me busy.” Wornell is a freelance photographer from Finland with Canadian origin.
Not just in Kathmandu, foreigners are living well in Pokhara as well. A Dutch YouTuber Thomas Klabbers, who arrived in Nepal to travel some six weeks ago, says, “Life is mostly quite empty. I spend a lot of the days on the rooftop of my hotel listening to music. But, regarding food and essentials, it is actually still surprisingly easy. The supermarkets and some small shops in Pokhara Lakeside have all the essentials. Some days I go out to buy groceries and film.”
Of course, many who are still in Nepal were given a choice to go back to their country, to their families. Yet they chose to stay here and continue their lives. Sandalls says, “Yes, there was a choice to go back on a repatriation flight, but I chose not to go because it would have meant that I would have to go through numerous airports and countries to go back to the country that is already in lockdown. I felt safer here and the point of lockdown is to stay put. That is what I am doing.”
For Klabbers, who was living in Vietnam, also, leaving did not seem like the best option. “I can’t go back because it’s also locked down there. If Vietnam was open, I would consider it, but it seems Nepal is still safer than Vietnam at the moment, with fewer cases of coronavirus and fewer people living close together.”
Meanwhile, Michelle, a travel blogger, came to Nepal in February and got married here to a Nepali man. So, she does not have plans to leave the country and she is busy with her work from home. But she says she is glad that her friends and family were able to fly back before the airports closed.
Concerns
Despite their choices to live here in Nepal, the foreigners seem concerned about their visa issues.
“My visa has expired as we are only allowed to be here for five months at a time. We can extend it after the lockdown but I am worried if we would not get sufficient time to process our papers and get the time to go back,” says Sandalls.
Another concern is their work. “Both I and my husband work in the travel business so our income was hit [because of the crisis]. My freelance clients are on a monthly contract so if they do not renew their contracts at the end of the month, the money will be tight. From surviving to helping others will depend on our expenses over the next week or two,” expresses Michelle.
Wornell who came to Nepal to enrol for a course in Bishwa Bhasa Campus to study Nepali has a valid visa for now, but is concerned that he might contract the virus. He says, as he would not want to take up the place of a Nepali in a hospital bed, he is being as careful as he can.
Doing what they can
Staying cooped up in the boundaries of a room is definitely not easy. That, coupled with the fear and uncertainty, does not make things any different. However, the foreigners are doing their part, contributing what they can.
“I have been catching up on some freelance work for companies in the USA and the UK. Also, I am doing some gardening and attempting to learn Nepali,” says Michelle. She further shares she also is doing her part by donating to Hiteri, a crowdfunding platform working to feed families who are having a hard time during this time.
“I am mostly staying in my home, but I am a photographer with a valid press pass so I go around and take photos too. I have extended the helping hand and am working with Kokroma, which is making masks for people during this time. So every few days when I go out, I am delivering them on my bike,” shares Wornell.
During his time out, Wornell is doing something that he hopes will make a difference after the crisis is over. “I am working on a personal project to capture this historic worldwide incident for documentation purposes. I think it will be a way to look back at the situation and I can give it a fresh perspective when it comes to the situation in Nepal.”
Sandalls has also shared his willingness to go on his bike and deliver food for the hungry. He has been in talks with a group ‘Lockdown Lunches’ distributing food on the streets.
Their observations of lockdown
Wornell says he admires the government’s decision to shut down early. “I am very impressed with the security personnel as they are strict in their checking. Whenever I go out, I get stopped 25 times to get questioned. I see each community has leaders working to enforce the lockdown in collaboration with the security personnel.”
But diving deeper, he has witnessed that underprivileged people are having the difficulty to manage social distancing.
Klabbers also says he sees the lockdown to be very effective as most people listen to the rules [in Pokhara]. “There are no big groups of people together. Almost all restaurants are closed. And, the police did not have to use force once in Pokhara during the lockdown. I can say that the people in Nepal are taking the situation very seriously and listening well to health advice.”
Sandalls also views that the lockdown is going well. However, he has observed that some people are not understanding the concept of social distancing. And, with people going to villages, he hopes the government can handle the situation better.
Adding to this, Michelle says, “I think the lockdown and closing the borders was a good idea, but it could have been handled better. The Nepali nationals left at the border without being able to enter were handled very poorly. Considering the number of empty hotels available, I think, the government should have quarantined them in the hotels and paid the hotel owners for space. I am sure many hotel owners could have used the money and people would not have been left homeless at the border.”"

After the number of coronavirus positive cases has been found increasing steadily, the Province 1 government has decided to expand the range of tests, of both types, namely polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
The province’s Minister for Social Development, Jeevan Ghimire, says the provincial government is identifying the places with high infection rates and testing all the suspected people there. Ghimire says the absence of symptoms of infection in the patients has made the tests tricky.
Besides over two dozen Covid-19 patients in Udayapur, one each coronavirus positive case has been found in Bhojpur and Jhapa districts of the province.
So far, 906 people have undergone the PCR test in the province whereas 4,160 the RDT."

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and the main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba have discussed contemporary political situations in the country.
After the top leaders of the ruling and opposition parties held a one-on-one meeting for around one hour, the ruling party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal also joined them.
Details of their discussions have not been divulged yet. However, it has been assumed that they discuss recent political situations in the country, and the controversy caused by the government’s decision to issue two ordinances in particular.
The prime minister’s press advisor Surya Thapa says the leaders discussed how the parties could come together in the country’s fight against the Covid-19 outbreak.
Deuba’s aide, Bhanu Deuba, however, says he is not aware of the matter."

Save the Children, along with the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) and National Health Education Information and Communication Centre (NHEICC), has collaborated with a popular comedy show, ‘Pawankali’, to develop web and radio-based contents for children on the Covid-19.
The ‘Pawankali’ show will be aired from the coming Sunday, every Sunday at 7:15 to 7:30 AM from various community FM stations in Nepal through the Community Information Network (CIN), as well as YouTube, and other social media channels.
“Understanding the need for child-friendly content in popular media, Save the Children is collaborating with the ‘Pawankali’ show to communicate with children, as well as the general audiences on the ongoing Covid-19 situation,” shared Bandana Risal, the interim country director of Save the Children.
The web and radio content of the ‘Pawankali’ show will discuss issues of rumour management, mental health, violence against children, and education through localised comedy skits, and interviews with technical experts, celebrities, and children from different parts of the country."

The main opposition party, Nepali Congress, has demanded that the government launch an independent probe into the incident in which People’s Socialist Party Nepal lawmaker Surendra Yadav was taken to Kathmandu in a style of abduction on Wednesday night.
On Thursday, Yadav had told media that he was for forcefully taken to Kathmandu by two lawmakers of the Nepal Communist Party and a former chief of Nepal Police in order to split his party. After he did not agree, the plan to split the party had failed.
After the government decided to withdraw the ordinance that was allegedly brought to relax provisions of splitting a party, the opposition party’s spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma on Thursday issued a statement demanding an investigation into the ‘abduction-style’ incident and action against the culprits.
Fearing that the government may spare them as some leaders of the ruling party were spared after returning the land in the notorious Baluwatar land scam, the opposition party has appealed to the public to stay alert."

Kathmandu, April 24
The government has assumed that around 300,000 Nepali migrants workers are preparing to return home after being hit by the global economic crisis induced by the Covid-19 pandemic.
A Cabinet meeting held on Friday morning had also discussed the demands of Nepalis living and working in various countries of the world. Of late, they have been demanding that the government repatriate them. However, Nepal is not yet ready as it does not have sufficient structures and arrangements to quarantine and rehabilitate them safely.
However, preparations have begun to measure the magnitude of the problem. In this context, the government has been reported by concerned authorities that around 300,000 workers including those legally and illegally working abroad are willing to return.
In the Gulf and Malaysia alone, around 1.5 million Nepalis are working currently. The government assures that there are some thousands of additional Nepalis, who are not documented yet.
“The prime minister has talked with his counterparts in Qatar, Cyprus, Bahrain, and many other countries to solve their immediate problems now,” a minister says, “They have agreed to keep them there for now, and take further decisions once the pandemic will be over.”
However, for the undocumented workers, the government will now focus on documenting them and repatriate, according to sources."

Four days after issuing two ordinances related to political parties and the Constitutional Council, the government on Friday decided to withdraw them.
A meeting of the Council of Ministers held this morning made the decision.
Both the ordinances had drawn severe criticism not only from opposition parties but within the ruling Nepal Communist Party also.
Apparently, taking advantage of the ordinance on political parties, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had launched efforts to split the Samajwadi Party. However, instead of splitting, the party merged with the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, consolidating its force.
After the failure, Oli on Thursday had said he would withdraw the ordinances.
Whereas the main opposition party had already launched street protests against them, senior leaders of the ruling party had also told the PM to withdraw them."

Kathmandu, April 24
The private sector has drawn the attention of the government on the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown on the country’s economy.
It has urged the government to provide 50 per cent of the money they need to pay the workers as a grant.
The office-bearers of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), and Nepal Chamber of Commerce (NCC) held discussions with the government’s Chief Secretary Lok Darshan Regmi to that connection on Thursday.
During the meeting, the private sector representatives urged the government to rescue the industry, commerce, and business sectors from the adverse impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
“Industries and factories in the country are on the verge of closure due to the lockdown. The supply system has also been hit hard and the national economy is also dented in such a situation,” the office-bearers of the country’s three big chambers of commerce and industry reported to the chief secretary, urging the government to create an environment for reviving the economy.

The government has spent around Rs 381 billion to reconstruct various monuments, structures, and residential houses destroyed in the 2015 earthquake in the first five years after that.
The reconstruction, however, has not been complete till now.
The National Reconstruction Authority says it spent Rs 309 billion via government agencies and Rs 72 billion via non-government agencies.
So far, 63 per cent of the earthquake survivors have completed the reconstruction of their residential houses whereas other 25 per cent survivors are reconstructing their houses currently, according to the authority.
“Thanks to the support and good wishes from various sectors, we have achieved the level at which we can present our achievements, experiences and learning about our reconstruction and restoration to the world with confidence and pride,” the authority’s Chief Executive Office Sushil Gyewali says, “If there had been a smooth environment everywhere, we could have achieved more, but it is already past.”
Meanwhile, for the past month, the reconstruction works have been disturbed by the ongoing lockdown."

The Nepal Students Union, the student wing of main opposition Nepali Congress, has launched protests against the government.
The organisation’s general secretary Deepak Bhattarai says five cadres of the organisation have gathered in each of the major places of the country. Today, they staged protests against the government move to issue two controversial ordinances.
Though the nationwide lockdown enforced to control the outbreak in the country is still in effect, the NSU managed to stage the protests.
Bhattarai says the protests will continue unless the government withdraws the ordinances."

The central vice-president of the National Private and Boarding Schools Association Nepal (NPABSAN), Krishna Prasad Bhusal, has been found dead in the Kailali district of Sudurpaschim province on Thursday night. Locals have suspected that he was murdered.
The operator of local Bihani Kshitij Boarding School in Gauriganga municipality of the district, Bhusal’s body was found in a place around one kilometre away from Pahalmanpur Bajaar of Ghodaghodi municipality of the district, according to the District Police Office.
The police say his body had cuts on eyes, mouth, and knees. Further investigation into the case is underway, informs DSP Daksha Basnet, the DPO spokesperson.
Two persons have been arrested for further investigation. A team led by DSP Gyan Bahadur Bista has been sent to the incident site."

Nepal is marking the fifth anniversary of the 2015 magnitude-7.6 earthquake on Friday as per the Nepali calendar. Five years on, the country is yet to complete the reconstruction of various historical and archaeologocial monuments.
Ranipokhari, a historical pond in central Kathmandu, is one of the monuments whose reconstruction was severely delayed. However, after seeing many controversies, the reconstruction had gained momentum of late. Authorities had aimed at reopening it after completing the reconstruction today, coinciding with the earthquake reconstruction.
However, the plan has been scattered owing to the ongoing lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
Till the day when the lockdown began last month, dozens of the workers were busy there, reconstructing the Balgopaleshwar Temple at the centre of the pond. However, everything has come to a sudden halt as the lockdown restrictions obstructed the movement of workers and transportation of construction materials.
“However, some workers were staying there before the lockdown began and they are monitoring the site now,” Sanam Shrestha, a site engineer of CA Tulasi Construction, informs.
Meanwhile, the concerned parties are discussing if the remaining workers can be carried out during the lockdown also, according to him. The District Administration Office has already issued movement permits to the workers for the project."

Owing to the government’s failure to mark ‘safe zones’ against ‘risky zones’, the government is unlikely to relax restriction measures imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country anytime soon.
The country has gone on lockdown on March 24, and its extension is expiring on April 27 as of now. Owing to difficulties created by the lockdown, some members of the public have demanded that the lockdown restrictions be relaxed in certain places where the risk is relatively low. The Ministry of Health and Population had also recommended so last week.
Then ministry had planned to categorise the country into red, yellow, and green zones in terms of the infection risks. During that time, the number of cases in Sudurpaschim was higher than in other places and the government was focused on that province. However, just a few days after the plan was finalised, 12 coronavirus positive cases were detected in Udayapur of Province 1, baffling the health officials.
So far, 48 positive cases have been confirmed, and 28 of them are in a town of Udayapur.
Hence, the officials think it is still too early to decide any place as a safe zone. “Currently, we are in action. We cannot say anything unless the experts suggest something new,” an expert advisor to the Ministry of Health, Dr Khem Karki, says.
Meanwhile, some public health experts have said the government has not tested as many people as required to mark the places into different zones. The ministry says so far 9,111 people have been tested in the PCR technology whereas 34,502 in the RDT. Public health expert Sameer Mani Dixit says the PCR tests should be expanded at the community level before making any decision about relaxing the lockdown."

Udayapur district alone has 25 Covid-19 patients so far.
Meanwhile, nine of them have already achieved recovery, Devkota says, adding two patients of Kathmandu, residing at Sun City Apartments, have been declared recovered in the latest cases. They have been discharged from the Patan Hospital, according to him."

Indian Ambassador to Nepal, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, handed over around 23-tonne medicines to Nepal’s Minister for Health and Population, Bhanu Bhakta Dhakal, on Wednesday as assistance to the country’s Covid-19 response.
However, two of the medicines have been found to be not yet approved by the country’s Department of Drug Administration.
Officials in the department say paracetamol 325 mg and dicyclomine HCL 20 mg not yet approved in the country. The embassy informs that there are 320,000 tablets of these two medicines in the package handed over to the minister.
The department’s spokesperson, Santosh KC, however, states that they can be used now if physicians recommend it. “In this special circumstance, we can consider them upon a recommendation of the physicians,” he says, adding their sale is not approved yet nonetheless."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "

The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

House of Representatives member Surendra Yadav was called by his old friend, immediate part inspector general of Nepal Police, Sarbendra Khanal, on Wednesday.
Khanal told him that he was in Janakpur and wanted to meet him. Yadav suspects Khanal had traced his location via his personal security guards.
Then, Yadav called Khanal to come to the place where he was. The former police boss was accompanied by two lawmakers of the ruling party, Mahesh Basnet, and Kisan Shrestha. The three told him that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli wanted to meet him, hence they were there to take him to Kathmandu.
“The IGP (Khanal) had told me that the PM wanted to meet me, but I was thinking of going to Kathmandu after the lockdown would be over,” Yadav says, “But, they reached my place. Whenever people go close to your village and say they want to meet you, our culture does not allow us to refuse.”
But as Yadav travelled to Kathmandu, he gradually sensed the intent of the calling. Oli had issued an ordinance relaxing the provisions of splitting the party just two days ago and had said it was targeted to some parties except his own NCP. Yadav was taken to Kathmandu because there were a few lawmakers of the Samajwadi Party, reportedly ready to split but they were short of one lawmaker to meet the criteria of splitting.
In Kathmandu, Yadav was taken to a hotel. “But, I came to know what they wanted, hence I ran away from the hotel during my morning walk,” Yadav says, “I reached my party chair (Upendra Yadav).”
He says, “Their behaviours were not like that of a kidnapping, but I had not wanted to come to Kathmandu during the lockdown. I would not have come home if I had known their purpose.”
After the Samajwadi Party consolidated itself with a merger with the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal before the splitting plan materialised, Oli’s mission has failed. He has already agreed to withdraw the controversial ordinance."
"
Apparently, after failing to achieve his mission of splitting the Samajwadi Party Nepal and facing severe criticism from inside and outside his party, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has said he would withdraw the controversial ordinance on political parties. He says the ordinance on the Constitutional Council will also be withdrawn.
In his meeting with the party’s executive chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal in his official residence of Baluwatar this morning, Oli agreed to withdraw the ordinances after consulting legal experts, according to sources.
The constitution allows the president to withdraw the ordinances issued by her at any time whenever the prime minister recommends so.
During the meeting, Dahal had advised Oli to call a meeting of the party’s standing committee as demanded by 20 leaders of the party recently. Before this, the party’s senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal had also suggested the same. He had told Oli that withdrawing the ordinance was a must to avoid an impending accident in the party.
Meanwhile, the party postponed ongoing discussions with its federal lawmakers citing it would require additional preparation. Earlier on Wednesday, Oli had met the lawmakers representing Province 1 and Sudurpaschim, justifying why the ordinances were introduced."

Party leaders of the erstwhile Samajwadi Party and Rastriya Janata Party Nepal today filed an application for the registration of their unified new party as People’s Socialist Party Nepal.
The leaders reached the Kantipath-based Election Commission early this morning to inform the governing body about the merger.
Speaking with the press at the commission, a leader of the newly formed party, Rajendra Mahato informed that other remaining procedures would be completed once the lockdown would be over, adding protecting people’s health should be priority now. Mahato also claimed that the party would not split under any circumstance.
At midnight, the Samajwadi Party and the Rastriya Janata Party had come to an agreement to merge the two parties into one."

Amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown, Nepal is celebrating the 14th Loktantra Day today.
However, no official programmes have been organised to commemorate the day when a 19-day-long movement for reestablishing multiparty democracy had been successful in the country. The movement later led to the establishment of the republic.
The reigning last Shah king of the nation, Gyanendra Shah had dismissed the then prime minister and appointed a new one of his choice. Later, still displeased, he had announced a coup and dismissed the cabinet in 2005 and took over as the head of the state himself.
Following that, in the leadership of the then Nepali Congress President Girija Prasad Koirala, the seven parties had jointly launched the protest demanding the restoration of the House of Representatives."

Today is Matatirtha Aunshi (also called Aamako Mukh Herne Din), a special day dedicated to Mothers, a day when Hindus worship mothers by conducting different rituals.
On this day, sons and daughters visit their mothers and gift various delicacies and garments among others.
Likewise, people gather at Matatirtha, on the outskirts of Kathmandu close to Thankot, to pay homage to mothers, who have left this world. Hundreds of people visit the holy site on this day every year.
However, the nationwide lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country has affected the celebrations this year. The Matatirtha Festival has been postponed. People have not been able to visit their mothers due to transport suspension.
Chandragiri municipality’s mayor Ghanashyam Giri says people have been urged not to make any crowds to avoid the risk of infection. The municipality has also deployed its staff to monitor if anyone violates the restrictive orders.
However, the daily worship in the holy site has continued uninterrupted even during the lockdown."

In this context, Onlinekhabar has recently talked to Standard Chartered Bank Nepal’s Chief Executive Officer Anirvan Ghosh Dastidar about the impact of the crisis and strategies to cope with it.
Excerpts:
The country is under the lockdown currently. How is Standard Chartered providing its services?
In line with the directive of the Government of Nepal and the Nepal Rastra Bank, we continue to provide banking services to our clients.  We have a well-tested and robust Business Continuity and Crisis Management Plan in place to ensure the continuity of banking services to our clients. This plan was activated even before the nationwide lockdown was announced. As an international bank, we are present in the countries that have seen the worst of Covid-19 crisis. While this is an unprecedented situation globally, our international access and presence have helped us prepare well in advance. We have vigorous protocols to ensure the safety of our staff and clients.
The staff members providing services to clients from branches adhere to the recommended safety measures such as social distancing, and the use of masks and sanitiser.  The clients are screened for temperatures while entering the branches.  We are operating our critical departments and limited branches in this situation. The centralised departments of the head office have been operating effectively by keeping minimum staff at the office and rest in work from home (WFH) arrangement. Approximately 50 per cent of our branches operate every day with reduced operating hours on a skeletal model.
We also have a robust technological infrastructure which supports working from home for the majority of our staff and also ensures that the clients’ needs are met even during challenging times like this.
We do have an active digital client base which is garnering full value of our digital capabilities; it has come very handy for us. We were also quick to launch an advanced version of our mobile banking app that enables the clients to access a range of banking services online.  We activated a few offers to our clients and offered them attractive discounts for the use of debit/credit cards by tying up with popular outlets like Bhat-Bhateni, Big Mart and Mero Kirana.   All our ATMs are up and running. We have received great feedback from our clients, which is very motivating.
What is the magnitude of challenges in the banking sector due to the Covid-19 crisis?
The operational challenges being faced by the banking sector in Nepal are largely being mitigated with support from the regulators. The impending closure of businesses, its impact on the cash flow of the clients and financial impact on the balance sheets of banks are yet to be ascertained. This is largely dependent on how soon we are able to control the Covid-19 spread.
The problem of liquidity in the market is also likely to emanate from subdued economic activities if the containment of the virus takes a longer period. This issue is also being faced globally where we are seeing various policy actions to maintain liquidity in financial markets and support businesses.
With certain norms being reconsidered and with the help of the regulators, we will overcome the challenges. For now, as we speak, the health of the citizens must come first, for which the lockdown is necessary. It is only after that other matters should be discussed.
What extent of damage do you foresee in the banks due to this situation?
I do not foresee any disaster in the banking sector, but we will definitely be facing challenging times ahead that will test the resolve of all.  With the understanding and support of the government and regulators, faith and goodwill that the clients place in us, the impact of Covid-19 will be collectively overcome.
This will be relative to how we collectively handle the situation with the help of the government and the NRB. The next few months will definitely result in a slowdown of businesses, but we are certain that we will bounce back and resume with more energy to fulfil what has been missed in between. Since the lockdown starting March 24, economic activities have been subdued. The cash flows of clients have been impacted.  This is not only a national but a global issue. Our estimate is that after the control of Covid-19, at least two to three months would be required for things to normalise.  Against this backdrop, if appropriate policies are framed, that would be supportive for all of us.
What are a few of the things that the banks should consider during this time?
The safety of staff, clients and community is of utmost importance to us in line with our brand promise of “here for good”. Therefore, we have strictly implemented our health and safety protocols. We will continue to support and cooperate with the government in its effort to minimise impacts on all the sectors.
With respect to staff, the Standard Chartered Bank has already announced that there will be no staff layoffs globally on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Staff motivation is key to our success. We also feel the mental health of staff during this time of crisis is important, therefore we have made it a point to engage constantly with staff at all levels through virtual meetings, routine communications sent out with updates and our approach to be available whenever anyone is in need of help.
We will continue to be client-centric.  The banks must be in close contact with their clients to understand their needs and how to address them best.  The Standard Chartered Bank stands to support communities where we operate. We have globally announced an assistance fund worth USD 50 million to those affected by the pandemic. This is in addition to commitment of USD 1 billion of financing, at preferential rates, for companies providing goods and services to help in the fight against the Covid-19. At the country level as well, we are proposing some sustainable and impactful programmes. We remain optimistic and will support keeping our economy resilient.
How do you take the recent decisions made by the NRB in response to the Covid-19 crisis?
The monetary measures introduced by the NRB have focused on protecting and providing much-needed relief to both banks and financial institutions, and clients. Measures on capital, liquidity, loan provisioning, regulatory ratios and regulatory reporting requirements have provided some relief to the banks. The suspension of countercyclical buffer and an increase in refinance facility are expected to give the banking industry an impetus for maintaining credit flows to the market in the current stressful environment. The relaxation of cash reserve ratio will ensure additional liquidity of around Rs 35 billion, fuelling additional revenues for the BFIs through investments in treasury bills and government securities, which will help the economy have cash during this time of need while the policy also ensures the clients benefit from interest discount upon instalment payments.
Additionally, the clients with financial distress due to this crisis can suspend debt payments by three months to Ashad end (mid-July) without any interest charges. Besides, provisions such as loan tenure extension for corporate houses, relief from additional loan loss provisioning and widening the scope of priority sector lending should support both the BFIs and clients.
This is the first time that this generation has faced a pandemic of this nature and we are all learning. The NRB has been supportive based on the facts and feedback that it has received.  We are certain that additional support measures for both the banks and clients are being considered.  The focus is now shifted from physical banking to digital banking. This is expected to help banks manage costs in the long run and facilitate the clients for convenient banking, which has long been our bank’s standpoint.
Working from home (WFH) has become a buzzword in the banking industry that starts a way forward for the banks to reflect their existing infrastructure like systems connectivity, digital information and business continuity management.
What should be the next steps of the government and the NRB for the banking sector? 
The impact of Covid-19 is evolving each and every day. The steps taken by both the Ministry of Finance and the NRB are in a positive direction so far. We can expect expansionary fiscal policies and accommodative monetary policies. The focus should continue to be on liquidity and funding conditions in the market. A new policy guidance should be drafted on new ways of working including working from home, split arrangements and the long-term implications of these arrangements. The business continuity management (BCM) of the banks should be reviewed for adequacy and effectiveness. Deferral of regulatory audits or acceptance of delays in the audit submission should be looked into. Cybersecurity risks must be a part of the consideration, particularly when people work from home.
Banks are providing services during this time, but safety is also very important. How careful are you about this?
Safety of our people is our topmost priority. We have looked into various aspects of staff wellbeing in the current situation and made arrangements for ensuring that the staff are taken care with utmost importance.
About the banking process, we are conscious of the potential elevation of the risks during this situation while we are simplifying processes to provide services to our client. Hence, there is heightened monitoring and tracking of exception to the normal processes.
Our cyber and fraud monitoring centres have increased their surveillance of potential cyber breaches and fraud incidents. Our people have adequate awareness of avoiding any such incidents. We have issued specific guidelines on remote working during the lockdown to help them ensure security standards even while working from home.
This is a time for exhibiting responsibility and exercising caution.  We are following all the safety protocols to safeguard the health and safety of our staff, clients and communities."

Two days after the government issued an ordinance relaxing requirements to split a party, two regional parties have decided to merge, fearing Oli was targeting dissatisfied leaders of their parties.
Top leaders of the Samajwadi Party Nepal and the Rastriya Janata Party signed an agreement to merge their parties some minutes before midnight yesterday. They have decided to name the new party as ‘Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal’ in Nepali and People’s Socialist Party Nepal in English.
The existing flag of the Samajwadi Party will be used as the flag of the new party whereas the party’s election symbol will be the umbrella, used by the RJPN now.
The four-point agreement does not mention anything about the leadership of the unified party. Though the leaders claim there will not be any dispute, it will be interesting to watch how they will manage it. Both constituents of the parties were formed out of mergers among different parties in the past few years. Unable to find an all-acceptable leader, the RJPN had a six-member presidium whereas the Samajwadi Party had different chairmen for the federal council and central committee.
Four leaders of each side have signed the merger agreement. They include Mahantha Thakur, Rajendra Mahato, Mahendra Raya Yadav, and Sharad Singh Bhandari of the RJPN, and Baburam Bhattarai, Upendra Yadav, Ashok Rai and Rajendra Shrestha of the Samajwadi."

The House of Representatives Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota and the National Assembly Chairman Ganesh Prasad Timilsina have urged the government to summon the new session of the Federal Parliament as soon as possible.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country and the consequent lockdown, the government is undecided about when the next session would begin.

With the discovery of more new cases every day, Nepalis are uncertain about how long this lockdown will continue and how long their ‘new lifestyle’ will rule them. Amidst this uncertainty, if people are getting fat every day is a concern for both the general public and the health personnel.
The ‘heavy’ risk
Priyanka Kumari, a 12th grader in Kathmandu is already overweight and she is worried that she might put on more weight during this time. She shares, “Luckily, as of now, I have not gained any weight, but still, I am stressed that I might gain more weight as I eat a lot and do not do any exercise. Most of the time, I am on my bed with my cell phone. I get off of my bed only to eat.”
Kumari says she used to walk and fro between her home and school regularly before the lockdown, but she does not have anything to go these days.
There are many like Kumari who fear that their complete sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of getting fat. A clinical dietician at Norvic International Hospital, Praniti Singh, also asserts that their worries and fears of putting on more weight might turn into reality.
She explains, “There is a risk that the one with normal weight might become overweight while one who is already overweight might become obese, leading to the risk of obesity for most of us as we are now adopting a sedentary lifestyle.”
Likewise, dietician Nani Shobha Shakya describes, “When one consumes a lot of food containing high carbohydrates and fat and cannot spend those calories, they gain weight. Now we are in our home only, and we tend to eat delicious rather than healthy food and more than our body requires. We also have more rest so there is a chance of gaining more weight.”
Similarly, Usha Ratna Shah, chief dietician at Grande International Hospital, views that people are stressed about the current pandemic and lockdown, and it also leads to overweight. She states, “When one is stressed, one tends to overeat and does nothing else. It also results in being overweight.”
According to Singh, this lifestyle, in which one lies on bed or couch all the time with their mobile on their hand and gets up from the bed only to have food, not only increases the risk of getting fat but also invites many other health problems like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases like high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, depression, anxiety, eye’s problems (due to watching mobile and TV screens all the time), bone problems (due to no or minimal physical movement) and many more.
Adding to this, Dt Shakya informs, “The health conditions of people who already are affected by non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases might get worse due to putting on more weight.”
Avoidance measures
To avoid the risk of getting fat, Dt. Singh suggests one must respect their circadian rhythm (sleeping and waking-up cycle). “It is a good thing that nowadays we are consuming a lot of home-cooked food,” she adds, “But, the eating timing must be appropriate to make that count. When our circadian rhythm is proper and fixed, we can fix our eating timing as well.”
She further adds, “Having small frequent healthy meals every two or three hours instead of having a lot of food at once is better. Doing any form of exercises anytime that suits them at least for 30 minutes per day inside the home using various YouTube tutorials or Playstore apps, keeping the body hydrated drinking a lot of water, getting up from the bed or couch every two hours and roaming all around the house for at least five minutes and avoiding alcohol and smoking can help balance the weight, she suggests. “Along with maintaining weight, following all these measures will boost one’s immunity and minimise stress and anxiety.”
Additionally, Dt Shakya mentions, “To escape the stress, people tend to overeat. So, in that condition, avoiding processed and junk food like chips, chocolates, instant noodles, cold drinks, juices, etc. and opting for healthy seasonal fruits and vegetables like carrot, cucumber, lemon water and many more can be the effective measures to eliminate the risk of gaining weight.”
Likewise, cooking only enough food for the family members so that there will be no leftovers can be helpful to prevent oneself from eating a lot and putting on weight. She also stresses, “One can also do household chores like cleaning, laundry or gardening which will increase their physical activity.”
Adding to all these, Dt Shah asserts, “Walking at least 5,000 steps every morning and night inside the house, doing recreational activities like dancing, playing available games incorporating every family members, avoiding fried foods and not going to bed immediately after having meals will aid in not gaining so much weight leading to a healthy lifestyle.”"

The Covid-19 has become a global health crisis. There are certain tendencies regarding the trends of incidence, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of the disease. The possible association of the gross national income with the epidemiological aspects of Covid-19 has not been studied and reported yet. In the list of Covid-19-affected countries, 20 countries belong to the high-income and upper-middle-income status. Most of the low-income countries have less than 500 cases of the Covid-19.
Health care is informed first by a scientific and medical understanding of how to prevent and treat the disease. The economy plays a key role in policymaking and its implementation to provide adequate health care.  It may also help in prioritising interventions to make the best use of resources, particularly in low-income countries and at the time when there is scarcity.
The incidence of the pandemic will not remain low in low-income countries. The response of these countries to the pandemic will also not be the same as in high-income countries. The scarcity of resources in low-income countries demands a strategic allocation and economical utilisation. The government may categorise resources into basic, limited, enhanced and maximal, then prioritise following its location or health institution. At the same time, providing limited to an enhanced level of interventions in a peripheral set-up and maximum level of interventions in a tertiary set-up are highly important.  A well-planned allocation and utilisation of resources are warranted to tackle the limitation of resources.
Nepal, being a low-income country, should have its national policy in combating Covid-19 based on its own needs and availability of resources. The Ministry of Health and Population of the Government of Nepal published Nepal Health Sector Strategy (NHSS) 2015 to guide the health sector of Nepal from 2015 to 2020. It guides the health sector’s response in realising the government’s vision to graduate Nepal from the status of a ‘least developed country’ to a ‘middle income developing country’ by 2022. Needless to mention, the NHSS was not formulated to assist combating a pandemic.
The total population of Nepal is 26.6 million and the current life expectancy of Nepalis is 66.6 years (NHSS 2015).  Only about 5.5 per cent of the population of Nepal is 65 years or over and about 51 per cent of it is younger than 24 years. The high-risk group of population to the Covid-19 is older than 65 years of age or individuals with chronic morbidities. The mortality rate of Covid-19 is significantly high in this group of patients in developed countries, but the proportion of this age group is small in Nepal compared to the developed countries. This may keep the mortality rate low in Nepal. According to the distribution of population by age, the number of younger people will outnumber the number of older people affected by the pandemic in Nepal.
Once the pandemic is over, there will be a tremendous need for effective counselling, and rehabilitation of the population. In particular, the younger population will be very important to revive the economy. The country should plan for it beforehand."

Kathmandu, April 22
Nepal recorded 11 new cases of coronavirus infection on Tuesday; all of them are from Bhulke, Triyuga municipality-3 of Udayapur district.
The Ministry of Health and Population confirms that they are all locals who got in contact with the Muslims who attended a religious function in India recently.
With this, the country has entered the third stage of the coronavirus outbreak, the community transmission. In the first stage, the country only saw ‘imported cases’ when all the infected persons had recently come home from other countries with the infection.
The first ‘local transmission’ case was confirmed on April 4, when the officials said the country entered the second stage of the transmission.
Public health expert Dr Anup Subedi says Bhulke of Udayapur has now been the hotspot of the coronavirus infection.
However, the government is yet to officially announce the country’s entry into the third stage. “So far, the positive cases are those who were in contact with other infected persons. We will look into a few more cases and decide if the infection has reached the community level,” an expert advisor to the Ministry of Health, Dr Khem Karki, says.

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

Balen Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu, met Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
Shah met PM Deuba at the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar.
During the meeting, Deuba pledged his entire support for his five-year term.
He states, “In the metropolis’ executive team, Congress has a majority. For development tasks, you will have complete support from the team. Take every measure for waste management; you will have everyone’s support.”"
"
“It’s great that someone as young as Balen has become Kathmandu’s mayor. I think it is. This is a win for people who wanted change. Balen has my full support,” says Sayami, adding he and Shah have a lot in common.
Now, Suman Sayami hopes Balen Shah will change things and keeps promises that he has made to the public about conserving the valley’s culture and tradition while creating change in how things worked in the country’s largest metropolis.
Even though Suman Sayami had not been active in politics, he got over 13,000 votes. Despite not being active in politics, he has served the people of the country in a different way. For over 10 years, he has been a social activist shedding light on issues relating to heritage, culture and civil rights. He was also a key person in the Guthi Bill movement.
“I’m someone who believes in work than talking. I don’t know how to speak to the public, which is why I wasn’t able to tell the public what I had done in the past,” he says.
Suman Sayami believes that he got over 13,000 votes due to Kathmandu’s core area, which involves areas occupied by the Newas.
“They know what I’ve done in the past, but sadly I couldn’t reach more people because I just didn’t have the time,” he adds.
He believes that he was aiming for more votes. In his estimation, he thought he would get between 20,000-25,000 votes. But, he is not disheartened as he takes the 13,770 as a positive step in his political career, which he says, has just started.
This means Suman Sayami is not going to stop. He is never going to.
“I used to think politics is a dirty game. But I realised that if people like me didn’t get into it and change it, nothing would change.”
He started getting vocal around 2015 when the state came to destroy his ancestral house in Kalimati in the name of road expansion. His home was built before the Panchayat era and was a safe space for all the communist leaders who held meetings conspiring on how to overthrow the Panchayat system.
When he saw the state was going to demolish his house, he could not withstand it. Suman Sayami, who would usually be at the back of the protests, was at the front and centre then. He could not see the state destroy the house where he grew up.
“They told me they had orders from above. That didn’t make sense because the house was legally owned by my family.”
Whenever there was a public holiday, he would get anxious. With every government office shut down, every time, he would face different issues on how to stop the excavators from destroying his home.
Sayami then started to speak to others like him and moved for a legal solution. They started talking to people from the Kalanki area whose houses were demolished in the name of development.
“The state didn’t deploy the excavator to destroy our houses. They deployed to destroy us because, for many people, the house was all they had. Where would these people go? This was nothing but a crime against humanity against us by the Nepal government.”
Their campaign turned into a movement and soon Suman Sayami was at the Supreme Court. The court ruled in their favour. But still not satisfied, they even moved to the international courts. It was only after the issue went international that the homes of Sayami and others were saved.
He knew that if the government could take away a citizen’s legal home, it could do anything and that paved the way for him to work to save the valley’s heritage and culture. He even formed forums and collected like-minded people to fight against the government.
He was everywhere, from protests against the proposed Guthi Bill to the building of the Kathmandu-Terai fast track that would take away land from the farmers of Khokona. He played a role in the Occupy Tundikhel campaign that raised awareness about the importance of open green spaces in the valley.
“The state wants to finish the history of Kathmandu in the name of development. They even tried to finish the guthis. I couldn’t sit and watch them do this,” he says.
Suman Sayami’s father Jivan Raj Manandhar was a communist leader and people told him he should join a communist party too. But, he did not want to. He felt that if he joined a party, he would be no different. He felt it would be against his principle.
But, he felt he needed to get into politics only to frame policies about things that the government was not addressing.
“I didn’t want to become a mayor. But, when I saw the party representatives, I felt sick and gave in my name,” he says. “I’m someone who understands the local level because I’ve worked there I felt I could be a good mayor.”
But, Suman Sayami agrees that he gave in his candidacy a little too late. Not being a part of any public discussions programme also did not help him get more votes.
“I thought what I had done in the past would be enough to convince people but I’m not sad because change has won this election,” says Sayami.
But, he has not lost hope as he now plans to contest the parliamentary elections and hopes people will vote for him then.

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Officials in the Ministry of Health and Population have confirmed additional nine cases of coronavirus infection in Updayapur district of eastern Nepal.
With the latest report, Nepal’s Covid-19 tally has reached 41. Of them, 23 are reported from Triyuga of Udayapur alone.
Among the Udayapur patients, most are said to be Indians.

Kathmandu, April 21
The government of Nepal has informed that one more person infected with the novel coronavirus has been found in the country on Tuesday.
With this, the number of the Covid-19 patients has reached 32 in the country. Of them, four are already recovered.
The 32nd case is also found to be residing at or close to a mosque in Udayapur district of eastern Nepal. Earlier, 13 persons were found to be infected there. Most of them are Indian nationals.
The Ministry of Health and Population spokesperson Dr Bikas Devkota says the swab samples of other persons who were in contact with the infected are being tested."

The Nepal Army has announced that it signed a deal with a Chinese government agency for purchasing the medical equipment required for the country’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak.
Organising an online press meet on Tuesday, the national military institution’s spokesperson Bigyan Dev Pandey made the announcement.
The deal is worth USD 18.44 million. A letter has been sent to the Nepal Rastra Bank requesting the fund transfer allowance, according to the army.
The army is using both land and air routes for the supply because a wide-body aircraft’s capacity is limited to around 20 tonnes only. The rest of the goods will arrive via Tatopani border point.
In total, around 340 tonnes of equipment will be purchased.
After annulling a controversial deal signed with Omni Group, the government had assigned the army to purchase the equipment. However, the Ministry of Health and Supplies has signed three other agreements to purchase various goods."

The main opposition party, Nepali Congress, has viewed that the government’s decision to issue two ordinances on political parties and the operation of the Constitutional Council reflected its authoritarian thought.
A meeting of the party’s office-bearers held at the party president Sher Bahadur Deuba’s residence in Kathmandu on Tuesday made the conclusion that it was a bad omen for the democratic constitution.
Whereas the public is fighting against the coronavirus outbreak and the security personnel and health workers are working risking their lives, the government has launched a game to make the constitution a failure, the party says in a statement issued after the meeting.
Upon a recommendation from the government, President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Monday had issued the ordinances. One of them allows a group in the party to split the party if it can secure 40 per cent support either in the party’s central committee or the parliamentary party, and the second lets the council decide without the main opposition party’s representation."

In the interview, Nabin Joshi speaks in length about COVID-19 and makes several claims. The interviewer hasn’t provided information about Joshi other than that he is a psychologist. According to Joshi’s Facebook page, he has a master’s degree in counseling psychology from Tribhuvan University (TU). Many people have also reacted to the video that Joshi shared on Facebook.
South Asia Check has examined eight of his claims.
First claim:
“About 25,000 to 56,000 people die each year from influenza-like illness. These deaths occur due to season change.”
A report published by the World Health Organization (WHO), on December 14, 2017, states: “Up to 650,000 deaths annually are associated with respiratory diseases from seasonal influenza, according to new estimates by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization and global health partners.”
Similarly, a report last reviewed on January 8, 2020, by the CDC has estimated that 34,200 people died during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
On the basis of these facts, Joshi’s claim is false.
Second claim:
“According to an Italian government website, among the people whose deaths were associated with the coronavirus, 48.5% died from other three illnesses. 25.6% died from two other illnesses, and 25.1% of people died from 1 other illness. These other illnesses included heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and pneumonia. Among the dead, some people already had two illnesses, some already had three or more and some had only one. This report says when their swabs were tested using real-time PCR test kits that showed false positive for coronavirus. However, it says the cause of the deaths were other illnesses. It says 0.8 percent of the dead had no other illnesses and this means influenza or seasonal flu was responsible for 0.8% deaths.”
The graph Joshi showed was taken from Bloomberg News and Bloomberg had analyzed the graphs prepared from Italy National Health Institute’s report. The analysis presented by Joshi in the video contradicts the analysis prepared by Bloomberg just below the graph. The Bloomberg analysis states, “The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions.
More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.”
The analysis does not state that the deaths occurred due to hypertension, diabetes or heart disease. Neither does it mention that the deaths occurred due to other illnesses. The report only analysed 18% of Italian COVID-19 deaths and whether the victims had pre-existing illnesses.
Joshi has given misleading information by misinterpreting the facts in the Bloomberg report.
Third claim:
“Its [PCR test kit’s] inventor was Kary B Mullis. He received the Nobel Prize for inventing this test kit 27 years ago. Since that time, WHO hasn’t recognized this kit for diagnostic purposes. Nobody used the kit for the past 27 years but it is being used now.”
The first part of his claim is true. American biochemist Kary B Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1993 for inventing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.
But the second part of his claim is false. A report published by WHO on April 29, 2003 states, “WHO encourages each country to designate a reference laboratory for investigation and/ or referral of specimens from possible SARS patients. Laboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt strict criteria.”
Similarly, WHO established a WHO working group on PCR protocols for detecting subtype influenza A viruses in 2007 to serve as an expert technical group to provide guidance to WHO on the use of PCR in the context of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).
As the PCR method is used for many other purposes Joshi’s claim is inaccurate.
Fourth claim:
“When reports of the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan came on December 31, the WHO said there was no reason to panic. But after 6-7 days, on January 8, the WHO held a meeting and said the virus is very aggressive and it’s a pandemic.”
A disease outbreak news update published by the WHO on January 12, 2020, stated that the coronavirus was only seen in Wuhan and detailed investigations were ongoing.
On January 13, 2020, officials confirmed a case of COVID-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside of China.
It is only on March 11, 2020, that the WHO declared COVID-19 as the pandemic.
Based on the facts above, Joshi’s claim is false.
Fifth claim:
“Nine years ago today, in 2011, the European Union declared that the WHO was a robber organization.”
South Asia Check could not find any such report on the internet. The media would have reported if such a serious accusation had been made by the European Union.
But there are other reports and news items that provide the basis for dismissing Joshi’s claim.
In 2011, the WHO, the EU, and other European countries had jointly published a report entitled “Migration and Health in the European Union” and the report has no mention of such an accusation.
Similarly, in the report titled “Everything you always wanted to know about the European Union health policies but were afraid to ask” published in 2014, we found no mention of such an accusation.
In addition, in September 2012, the “Health 2020: the European policy for health and well-being” framework signed by the European Union’s 53 member states also has no mention of such an accusation.
In The New York Times and Science Magazine, some committees and experts have published critical views of the WHO’s response to the swine flu pandemic but these also do not contain the accusation claimed by Joshi.
So, this claim is also false.
Sixth claim:
“It is meaningless to say that wearing a mask protects you. Mask does not protect people.”
An interim guidance issued by the WHO on January 29, 2020, states: “Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit the spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted.”
Similarly, the CDC in a report said, “The use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.”
As the two major expert organizations in the health sector, the WHO and the CDC have said that wearing masks prevents the spread of COVID-19 to some extent, Joshi’s claim is false.
 Seventh claim:
“One hundred years ago today, even then, there was the H1N1, a Spanish flu. Ten million people died from it.”
According to a report titled “1918 pandemic (H1N1 virus)” published by the CDC, the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 infected an estimated 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.
So Joshi was wrong here also.
Eighth claim:
“[The mortality rate for] swine flu, bird flu is very high, out of 100 people infected, 9 could die. But the mortality rate of the current coronavirus is about 0.1%.”
An article published by The New England Journal of Medicine reported, “The overall case fatality rate has been less than 0.5%, and the wide range of estimates (0.0004 to 1.47%) reflects uncertainty regarding case ascertainment and the number of infections. The case fatality rate for symptomatic illness was estimated to be 0.048% in the United States and 0.026% in the United Kingdom.”
Similarly, an article published in Plos One journal stated, “Investigators have suggested the case fatality ratio (CFR) for pH1N1 may have varied between 0.01% and 0.008%. Although these CFR estimates are probably based on under-estimates of death due to pH1N1, they are two orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the CFR up to 2% that has been widely accepted for the pandemic of 1918–19.”
Similarly, according to a Reuters news report of January 13, 2013, an international research group said that swine flu mortality rate was only 0.02%.
By looking at the previous reports and investigation, even though there is no worldwide homogeneity in swine flu mortality it is obvious that it is not 9% as claimed by Joshi.
According to the WHO, the mortality rate of people infected with bird flu (H5N1 virus) is about 60 percent.
Similarly, in one of the reports published by the CDC on bird flu reported, “Although human infections with this virus are rare, approximately 60% of the cases have died.”
Since the mortality rate of bird flu is much higher than Joshi’s claim, he is wrong again.
The “situation report-46” published by WHO on March 6, 2020, states: “While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%.”
These figures also confirm that Joshi’s claim is false.
The article first appeared on South Asia Check."

Various parties have objected to the government’s decision to issue two ordinances related to the operation of political parties and the Constitutional Council.
Upon a recommendation from the government, President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Monday had issued two ordinances amending the two laws. One ordinance allows a group in the party to split the party if it can secure 40 per cent support either in the party’s central committee or the parliamentary party, and the other lets the council decide without the main opposition party’s representation.
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party says the ordinance was unnecessary, inappropriate, and against sentiments of the constitution.
Likewise, the Sajha Party chief Rabindra Mishra has commented that the decision to issue the ordinances shows authoritarian aspirations in Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.
CPN-Masal has said the ordinances made the party believe that some serious conspiracy is being hatched in the country.
The main opposition party, Nepali Congress, is holding a meeting of the party’s key officials in Kathmandu to decide how to respond to the ordinances."

The university has already distributed 180 litres of sanitiser, packed in 20-ml bottles, to vegetable vendors in Narayangadh on Monday.
Bharatpur Mayor Renu Dahal, the university’s Vice-Chancellor Sharada Thapaliya and the Biotechnology Centre Director Ishwari Kadariya distributed the sanitiser among the vendors. During the distribution, the university officials urged the city government to support the university in the collection of raw materials and its marketing."

Instead of imposing a nationwide lockdown, South Korea enabled itself to better manage the Covid-19 pandemic with different, effective and systematic strategies and received applause from the world.
Korean authorities eminently launched rapid, aggressive and unprecedented alternative approaches: extensive testing of the contacts of confirmed cases, tracing for those potentially exposed to the virus with the means of credit card activity, surveillance camera footage and mobile phone tracking, packing infected cases and contacts in mandatory quarantine, advising the public to stay home, restricting public events, maintaining social distance and wearing masks when going outside, and following good hygiene practices.
With systematic and comprehensive efforts of physical, mental, economical, political and technology components, Korea has been restraining the impacts of this contagion to its grip. Korean authorities and health services properly managed Covid-19-related serious or critical cases in a better fashion, limiting morbidities and mortalities significantly lower compared to the overall impacts of the disease in other developed countries in Europe and America. The enormous efforts shown by Korea to prevent further infections are an example for other nations as the Covid-19 curve has already been plummeting steadily from the first week of March.
It is definitely an important lesson how Korea has achieved these statistical parametres so far for this contagious and pernicious pandemic, we need to investigate and apply those strategies and measures if found useful in combating against the outbreak and crisis in Nepal.
Epidemiological scenario

South Korea, which has an area of 97,230 square km and around 51 million population, significantly restricted the spread of Covid-19 to 10,674 cases and 236 deaths until April 20, far less than expected public health havoc.
On January 19, a 35-year-old Chinese woman entered Korea and she diagnosed positive on January 20 at the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) laboratory, which was the first infection case in Korea and one of the early cases outside mainland China. Immediately, Korean authorities raised the alert level of blue (general risk) to yellow (significant risk) and by January 24, Korea rapidly strengthened Covid-19 diagnostic services at 17 regional laboratories.
Evaluating the increased public health risks, on January 27, authorities forewarned alertness from yellow to orange (high risk). Critically analysing the trends of spread and impact caused by the novel coronavirus, the WHO on January 31 then declared it a ‘public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)’.
Later, on February 4, the Korean authorities enforced entry restriction from Hubei, and capacity building for diagnostic facilities (Nucleic Amplification Test-NAT) was expanded to 46 laboratories incorporating tertiary hospitals. By contact tracing and investigation of the first index case, authorities traced down to the 29th case which was diagnosed positive on February 16. However, there was not any direct epidemiological link found. Therefore, the community transmission was speculated and it raised significant health emergency situations. On February 19, the first pediatric case was reported and the next day the first death was announced.
On February 23, the Korean government bolstered the alert level raising to red (highest or severe risk) and delayed the school start for a week. As of February 29, 76 countries banned Koreans from entering their territories. By March 2, there were 22 Covid-19-related casualties reported; the school calendar got delayed repeatedly. They continued online classes bolstering social distancing to minimise the risk of transmission.
As of March 2, Daegu had the highest numbers of confirmed cases in Korea, with 1.26 cases per 1,000 persons. The numbers of laboratory tests performed were highest in two major cities; 16,382 tests in Seoul with a positive rate of 0.6% and 10,958 tests in Daegu with a positive rate of 28.1%.
The spread of Covid-19 skyrocketed from around 200 cases to 7,000 cases from the third week of February to the first week of March. By the first week of, March the death toll increased to 50. As of March 15, Korea tested 534,552 suspected populations and diagnosed a total of 10,591 positive with 225 deaths, 7,616 recovered and 2,750 active cases.
By March 17, around 79 church devotees have been reported to be infected. The belief of spraying salt water into the mouth of the devotees could  deactivate the virus was claimed for the rapid outbreak in the respective population. Then, Korean authorities strictly directed all churches to implement preventative measures, like fever screening, two-metre personal distancing, and wearing masks and encouraged them to go online for Bible teaching and other activities.
However, there was a four-fold mortality increase from the first week march to the first week of April and new confirmed cases crossed 10,000. By April 17, out of 532,277 tests performed, the reportedly confirmed and deceased cases were 10,635 and 230 respectively. Still, the fatality rate was just 2.1%, significantly lower than the WHO’s global case fatality rate of 3.4% as of March 3. It was above 10% in many European countries such as Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom then.
Summarising, the epidemic context in Korea can be categorised into four stages: Phase I: Before February 22; Phase II: February 22 to March 1; Phase III: March 2 to March 8; and Phase IV since then.
Covid-19 outbreak in religious groups

On January 27, the brother of a religious leader got hospitalised at the emergency ward of Daenam Hospital. Later, 170 members of the religious group visited his funeral from January 31 to February 2. On February 7, a 61-year-old woman, who was reluctant to get tested despite having symptoms, had a car accident and got admitted to the Oriental Medicine Hospital in Dague later. Then, she went to church on February 9, and to the wedding ceremony on February 15 and got exposed to hundreds of people. She was finally diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive on February 18 as the 31st patient in Korea. Tracing her entire movements, authorities found she attended two worships at the Shincheonji Church in Dague exposing to more than 1,000 members. Consequently, there was a strong voice of the public against the religious group for not implementing preventative actions and measures. The authorities, however, aggressively traced 210,000 attendees.
Exposure of coronavirus among the members of the religious group, along with community and hospital transmission, is believed to be vital players of an exponential increase in numbers of Covid-19 cases in Korea. Even in Nepal, large religious groups might be secretly conducting their activities. Local authorities need to watch and completely follow measures and stop their activities. This is critically important as 13 Covid-19 cases were related to a mosque in Udayapur.
Preventative measures and lesson learned
When Korea learned about the SARS-CoV-2 cases in China, it immediately endorsed preventative actions and measures such as encouraging all public to wear masks, informing about personal distancing, even before confirming any case in the country. Korea rapidly fulfilled the high demand for enough masks, foods, sanitiser, and medications enhancing production facilities. The authorities entirely controlled and placed a systematic policy for appropriate distribution.
In Korea, viral disinfectants such as sanitise have been easily available and placed enough in all public areas, public buses and toilets, subways, trains, universities and wherever needed. But, Nepal does not have the capacity to develop special respirators (N-95), personal protective equipment (PPE), viral disinfectants, and temperature scanning guns. The import of these materials has been delayed. Black marketing of these necessities should be monitored and completely discouraged currently.
In Korea, for efficient screening, around 638 clinics and screening centres have been in operation by April 8, of which 95 per cent have been equipped to collect samples on site. In Korea, there are 118 locations – 23 public facilities, 81 healthcare facilities, and 14 commercial laboratories – that provide SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis services where five diagnostic tests have been fast-tracked. Scaling diagnostic facilities and allowing fast-track testing, the daily testing capacity increased from 3,000 in February to approximately 20,000 people in April.
Korea expeditiously developed testing kits and heightened capacity building for laboratory testing facilities and made them available in various locations.
In Nepal, there was just a single laboratory diagnosis facility, Nepal Public Health Laboratory, until March 29, but the government expeditiously set up and upgraded Covid-19 laboratory testing services in all provinces. So far, 13 NAT-Based testing platforms are functioning. However, their efficiency is not satisfactory to handle a high number of cases if the outbreak reaches the third stage of community transmission.
Though the WHO recommended the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) only for research use and not for decision making for patient care, the government also aggressively moved to test the suspected and their contacts in this technology. These easy, safe, cheaper and rapid tests have massively been launched for mass screening and contact tracing and suspected cases of Covid-19 in potential risk areas in Nepal. These tests have been found applicable to dig out the hidden infected cases. These tests rarely detect the early onset of infections up to seven days as it needs to capture the limit of detection of IgM against SARS-CoV-2 after virus infection in the body. The rapid tests for late infection cases (IgG) might give contrary results. Hence, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is considered the gold standard for case confirmation.
By April 20, in Nepal, out of total 8,414 samples tested, thirty one positive cases were revealed from NAT-based RT-PCR where four confirmed cases have been recovered. Nearly 20,000 RDTs have also been conducted. Recent 15 new positive cases possessed a high risk though there was one local transmission case revealed so far in Nepal.
The government should encourage universities, institutes, academies, research centres, private hospitals and diagnostic centres for laboratory testing, diagnosis and further research activities for a prompt response to the disease in Nepal. Korea made enormous efforts to make enough supply of essentials, which Nepal is still lagging behind.
Rather than imposing the nationwide lockdown, Korea practised tracking security camera footage, cell phones, GPS data, credit card records, vehicle navigation, and other possible tracking and controlling measures and systems to track the contacts of the suspected cases or confirmed index cases. In Nepal, the nationwide lockdown has continuously been enforced since March 24, but the government needs to activate and upgrade these technologies also.
In Korea, someone diagnosed as the coronavirus positive can choose to stay isolated at home, but if s/he is found to be violating the rule, s/he will be fined up to $2,500. Under the revised anti-infectious disease law, the authorities can keep violators in prison for one year and fine $10,000, or deportation if s/he is a foreigner. Though the number of new cases is rapidly plummeting to very low numbers (20 cases per day), the authorities continued strict monitoring, requesting the public to follow proper safety, social distancing, and self temperature measures.
The public gets informed by authentic sources, preventing from rumours and hoaxes. Every public can check recent updates about the outbreak by accessing a website. In Nepal, however,  fake news, rumours, and hoaxes are still challenging though the government hosts a media briefing every day and has set up a web platform for the updates.
Korea has closed borders with its neighbours. However, we have an open border with India. Therefore, the authorities should make extra efforts to control movements and prevent inter-country transmission. In Korea, the greeting culture is contributing to stopping the spread in this situation as they tilt their heads to greet each other.
Similarly, we also have a great greeting culture of Namaste, vegetarian lifestyle, and distancing practices which are helping us to control the viral spreading.
Valid information should flow from respective field experts with scientific knowledge, not by politicians having superficial information. The government should encourage and provide physical and mental support and risk benefits to the frontline fighters.
In Korea, the authorities always put citizens first and respect their human rights and stand as a guardian whenever they need in their hard times in such a crisis. In Nepal currently, floods of needy workers, desperate to go home, have secretly been walking to reach their destinations evading authorities and securities as they do not have anything to eat and any penny to get food and water in the cities.
All three levels of the government need to act immediately to manage those pedestrians to reach their homes safely and quarantine them wherever they reach, providing support packages and basic accommodation. Otherwise, they possess public health threats to themselves and others.
The government should act immediately to address the concerns of these citizens, represent and stand as their guardian in their hard times in this ongoing health crisis and not create such a situation that they may lose their hopes and trust in the authorities. Rather than imposing security threats to them, the government should also protect their basic human rights. Otherwise, they can die of hunger and thirst, get hurt from the relentless journey and possess equal risks to all.
The government of Nepal has taken essential measures and is wholeheartedly committed to fighting against the disease. Recently, the Ministry of Health and Population endorsed a ‘six T’ strategy (travel registration, testing, tracing, tracking, treatment, and togetherness) to combat the outbreak in Nepal. All these six components should be implemented rigorously and efficiently.
Besides the six Ts, the local authorities should provide support packages (food and essentials) to the needy without any delay as the lockdown has already been around four weeks. They should properly monitor emergency preparedness and response and implement the necessary actions promptly.
Finally, the government of Nepal needs to review and judge meticulously all the systems and measures Korea adopted to efficiently manage the crisis. If these systems and measures are found appropriate and applicable in Nepal, the government should implement immediately for a major breakthrough regarding controlling the outbreak.
We should make a better history than Korea that the rest of the nations could learn from us that one of the least developed countries could cope with this situation with great action plans, strategies and measures despite limited resources and constrained health facilities.

Perhaps some of you have been tired of hearing about the coronavirus crisis and its impact on daily life, time and again. Obviously, it is important for you to get aware of what’s happening in the world due to the newly discovered virus and keep yourself protected. However, it is also time to get away with the Covid-19 obsession.
Before the lockdown began, Onlinekhabar had presented you two travel stories about Dolakha. Now, it’s time to go through the final part.
—
Dolakha’s Tripura Sundari (Goddess Bhagawati), closely associated with the legend of the town, succeeds as another most revered deity after Bhimeswor.  Housed in a temple-building called Devikot, the sacred site is located some 200 yards down stone stairs from the Bhimeswor Temple. The building was recently rebuilt after it was razed to the ground by the April 2015 earthquake.
Tucked away on a quiet and isolated forested ridge, the temple premises is adjoined by a beautiful park called Champuja, which treats the visitors with a stunning view of the Gaurishankar Himal, the Sunkhani village on the other side of the hill followed by the Dolti river valley and lush rolling hills that drop steeply to the river Tamakoshi. A dense forest called the Kanlad skirts the edifice on three sides.
At Tripura Sundari, visitors are barred from viewing the main deity. Only the main priest is entitled to perform a puja on behalf of the devotees. Believed by the local folks to have been built before the Mahabharat era or the Dwapar Yuga, this shrine is shrouded in mystery and occult beliefs.
“In the olden times, people feared to visit this temple premises after sundown,” says Shyam Shrestha, a member of the temple guthi (trust). Those who mistakenly wandered off to the temple surroundings after sunset went missing; they were devoured by the demons that lurked nearby the site,” reveals Shrestha. Surprisingly, the locals of Dolakha still hold the deity with fear and respect and balk at the idea of visiting the temple after dark.
Newar settlement
Home to a rich culture and tradition, Dolakha town is predominantly a Newar settlement. The Newari dialect from Dolakha is, however, way different from that of Kathmandu. Nonetheless, both languages have some words with identical meanings, like ja (rice), baji (beaten rice), chen (house), khan (talk), Mahani (the Dashain festival), kija (brother), kehen (sister), to cite a few.
Like their peers in Kathmandu, the Newars from Dolakha are represented by Shresthas, Pradhans, Joshis, Maskeys, and Rajbhandaris. Going by the Puranas (ancient scripture), the Dolakha language saw its birth during the Mahabharat era when the Panch Pandavas (the protagonists of the epic), sentenced to one year in exile, went into hiding in Dolakha.
To keep themselves incognito, the five Pandava brothers conceived this unique dialect. Another school of thought, however, believes that the Dolakha language has its roots in Kathmandu Newari and was introduced by itinerant traders and government incumbents assigned to the town for a prolonged sojourn. Some, however, argue that the people of Dolakha evolved their indigenous language to suit local customs and environment, and may have adapted a little from the migrant Newari dialect from Kantipur or ancient Kathmandu. The issue is still in the dark and open to controversy. And the history of ancient Nepal has little to offer.
Curiously, the Dolakha dialect also embraces expressions from other ethnic communities like the Thamis, the Sherpas, and the Tamangs. Amazing as it may sound, even the Bengali word ‘taka’ meaning currency is used in the Dolakha dialect with the identical meaning.  This seems to offer linguists a challenging case fora deeper study.
Bucket list 
While in Dolakha, your itinerary can include a cluster of unique destinations on your bucket list. Short hikes can allow room for a trip to Nagdaha, Sunkhani, Busti, and Saharpa to enjoy the pristine countryside, or make your mouth water with fresh-caught asla (snow trout) from the river Tamakoshi at the teahouses at Nayapul, some 20 km away.
Given a clear morning, the village folks claim a short 45-minute walk to the crest of a hill called Trishulcha, north of the Dolakha Bazaar, allows you to clap your eyes on the tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest (8,848 m) behind a panoply of lofty peaks including Melungtse Himal (7,181m). As the spot also holds a deity, local devotees often visit the place to offer a puja (worship).
A jeep ride from Charikot/Makaibari to the ancient pilgrimage site, the Kalinchok Bhagwati (3,842 m) is a dream destination. Recently, a cable car service came into operation, which shuttles visitors to Kalinchok from Kuri.
Another destination, a Sherpa village called Beding (3,700 m), once referred to as the land of Everest summiteers, is a three-four-day trek, leading to the picturesque Rolwaling Valley at the base of the Gaurishankar—serving as truly a lifetime experience.
For anthropologists, the ethnic Thami villages like Sushpa, Kshyamawati, Khopachagu, Alampu, and Bigu offer a great opportunity to study those rare communities whose numbers are on a rapid dwindling trend.
Jiri, a town often compared with Zurich in Switzerland, is only 55 km away. Before the construction of an airstrip at Lukla, Jiri served as a gateway to Namche and the Khumbu or the Everest Region, and once boasted as the summiteers’ hub.
The trek to Shailung Danda (3,150 m), also known as the ‘land of 100 hills’ is worth its weight in gold. What distinguishes the highland moor is the amazing sight of midget hills that roll out by the hundred. You can take a bus to Mude and trek the dirt road to the spot, some 25 km away. The site also offers another pilgrimage called the Salilungeswor Mahadev at an elevation of 3,500 m.
The high elevation of Shailung affords a stunning Himalayan panorama stretching from Dhaulaigiri, Annapurna, the entire Langtang Range to Ganesh Himal and the Rolwaling region. To the north, stands high the Kalinchok ridge. It is said a distant view of Kathmandu Valley in the north-west and the Tarai plains in the south can be viewed on a clear morning.
If you fancy visiting monasteries, a two-day trek to a village called Bigu will charm you with its seminary for Buddhist nuns (anis). Or, maybe you are hung up on some hardcore trekking and wish to attempt Tsho Rolpo, Nepal’s biggest glacier at 4,581m, which was once under threat of bursting in the late 1990s. You will, however, need professional help, and specific gear for this is an arduous trek.
For accommodations, Dolakha has a number of lodges and resorts catering to your needs. Visitors can also stay the night in Charikot, 4.5 km away, if need be.
Folklore and myths 
Apart from a rich culture and history, Dolakha is shrouded in folklore and dark mystery.  The village elders in Dolakha still believe those who perform as Gods, in the Khadga Jatra celebrated every Dashain, are visited by the Gods–and a few chosen ones, are possessed. The festival marks the triumph of virtue over the forces of evil as the Gods put an end to the terror begot by the danavs (demons). Pitched battles take place between the gods and the demons as a part of the festival.
A wooded hill southwest of the town called the Saharpa has weird lore attached to it. “During the days of our forefathers, people from Korchhe Tole (street) often went to Saharpa Danda (hill) to collect firewood. That went on for many years,” Parwati Shrestha from the Tallo Tole said as she recounted the bizarre happening that took place.
“One day, however, a strange incident took place at Saharpa,” she continued. “A group of woodcutters turned mute on their return to their neighbourhood. That occurred again with a band of another group from Korchhe. Now, that was a serious matter. So, a shaman was summoned to find the solution followed by a puja to the forest goddess at Saharpa. Miraculously, people stopped getting mute after that,” she concluded. The Saharpa hills can be easily sighted from Dolkha town.
Coup de grace
On April 25, 2015, the ground beneath the quiet little town shook violently as the massive 7.6 magnitude earthquake jolted Nepal. The Dolakha district, among others, was the hardest hit. Still reeling from the traumatic condition with a great loss of life and property, Dolakha was struck again on May 12, 2015, by another disastrous 7.3 magnitude quake bringing in its wake further devastation that dealt a crippling blow to the already tottering infrastructure.
Almost 90 per cent of the historical monuments and relics were razed to the ground by the quake. Apart from the great loss of human lives, the town looked all but a grisly scene of mass destruction and mayhem. By some small miracle, the Bhimeswor, the most revered temple of the Dolakhes (people of Dolakha town), save for some minor damages, survived unscathed.
Dolakha, however, lost virtually all those vintage stone-and-mortar houses, which had survived the epic earthquake of 1934 (1990 BS). One such house included my grandfather’s, which had weathered 150 years and lived in by three generations. But miracles do happen. An older than 300-years-old house survived the earthquake (view picture in this story’s part II).
It seemed the ill-fated town would never regain its former self. Dolakha revived from the catastrophe slowly, though. It took almost three hard years to get back on her feet again. The famed Tripura Sundari Temple, reduced to rubbles by the large temblors, is rebuilt today. So are more than 90 per cent of other relics and monuments scattered around the town to their past splendour.
It looks like Dolakha has lost none of its enduring charisma and promise, both as a pilgrimage and a memorable getaway. The people of Dolakha have proudly preserved their ancient relics and monuments and upheld their faith in their tradition, culture and religion to this day. And the tiny medieval town still stays to charm curious visitors time and again.

As a part of the commitment to support the Government of Nepal in its efforts towards containing the coronavirus outbreak in the country, the United Nations Population Fund today handed over 1,200 personal protective equipment kits to the government.
The PPE kits were donated by the Government of China under the Nepal, China and UNFPA south-south partnership initiative. The kits worth Rs 30.48 million include surgical masks, N95 masks, face shields, eye goggles, head and shoe covers, long-sleeve impervious gowns, disposable bags, and gumboots, the UN agency informs in a statement.
Receiving the PPE kits, the Director of the Management Division in the Department of Health Services, Bhogendra Dotel, said, “These PPE kits arrived in a timely manner and will greatly help in our response to the Covid-19 pandemic. We thank UNFPA and the Government of China.”
Likewise, UNFPA Country Representative for Nepal, Lubna Baqi, said, “With more people in need of testing and treatment amid the increasing number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country, it is critical to protect the frontline health workers. Attention should be given to their work environment as well as their health and psychosocial needs at this time.”"
"
Nepali Congress president and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has urged the government to expand the range of coronavirus tests to the community level.
The main opposition leader issued a statement on Monday and told the government to expedite the testing across the country.
Meanwhile, Deuba said the government should manage sufficient medical equipment and relief materials to maintain the situation under control during the ongoing lockdown.
He requested all to stay united in the fight against the epidemic."
"
The government on Monday decided to issue an ordinance to amend the existing law on political parties. A Cabinet meeting held today made the decision.
A minister on the condition of anonymity confirms the decision. It has been learned that the government has decided to change existing provisions on splitting a party.
Currently, a group within the party has needs at least 40 per cent majority votes in the parliamentary party and the central committee. Sources say the amendment ordinance will say that the party wishing for the split needs to secure at least 40 per cent majority votes either in the parliamentary party or the central committee.
‘Maoist’ ministers in a separate meeting
Meanwhile, the ministers representing the former CPN-Maoist Centre side have gathered for a separate meeting. On the other hand, Energy Minister Barsha Man Pun went to meet the party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s residence in Khumaltar today. Immediately after the Cabinet meeting in Baluwatar, they went for another meeting.
Sources say these incidents confirm that there is a serious division in the ruling party. Some have speculated if the party that came into existence with the merger of the then CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre two years ago is splitting again."

The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu is losing around Rs 250 million in its revenues every day since the lockdown began and national and international flights got suspended in the last week of March.
Whereas the airport would be busy almost round the clock and the aircraft had to wait for up to one hour to land, the country’s biggest operational airport sees just one or two flights currently. They, too, are not commercial. Whereas most of the flights are meant for evacuation purposes, the Nepal Army also conducts some flights to collect swab samples for coronavirus tests.
The general manager of the airport, Devendra KC, says the airport earns Rs 700 million every month whenever it is in operation in general. The aircraft have to pay for every landing and taking-off.  Likewise, the aircraft and the companies also pay for aeronautical, non-aeronautical and airport development.
Each international passenger pays Rs 1,000 for a flight. Besides, dozens of shops inside the airport pay monthly rents to airport management.
The airport served 7.33 million passengers in 2019, according to airport management. It means around 20,000 passengers travel via the country’s only international airport every day."

As many as 110 Russian nationals stranded in Nepal due to the lockdown imposed here to control the coronavirus outbreak have been evacuated on Monday.
The Russian government had sent a Royal Flight aircraft to evacuate them. The aircraft landed at 10:30 am at the Tribhuvan International Airport today and took off for Moscow at 12:40 pm.
After the beginning of the lockdown on March 24, around 4,000 foreigners have been evacuated from Nepal by their governments so far, according to officials."

The government has decided not to cut down on the salary of health workers and security personal for generating funds for the country’s Covid-19 response.
The government has issued an instruction in this regard to the concerned agencies. A recent meeting of the high-level committee on coronavirus outbreak control made the decision, according to Narayan Prasad Bidari, a secretary of the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers.
Other civil servants, however, will be required to contribute the pay of three to seven days, depending on their position, to the fund, Bidari informs.
A few weeks ago, the Nepal Police Headquarters had decided to cut down on the pay of the police officials from three to seven days and deposit the amount in the Covid-19 response fund. The decision was widely criticised."
"
The demand for an all-party mechanism to lead and execute the government’s Covid-19 response in the country has come to the surface again as a committee in the House of Representatives issued a directive in this regard.
Earlier, a few minor parties had demanded such a committee, which Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been vehemently rejecting. Of late, the main opposition Nepali Congress is also raising voice for such a mechanism at the local level.
The State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament on Sunday directed the government to form an all-party mechanism in all constituencies under the leadership of a federal lawmaker to monitor the situation in the constituencies. The committee’s chair Shashi Shrestha says the decision was made so that all stakeholders could own the process.
A few members of the committee, however, have said such a mechanism is not necessary."

Dairy farmers in Rupandehi district have begun distributing milk to the consumers for free as they failed to supply it to other markets due to travel restrictions during the lockdown.
The Saljhandi Dairy Producer Cooperative in Saljhandi, Sainamaina municipality-10 of the district, distributed milk to the local consumers in Sainamaina and Butwal today. It also provided milk for free to Province 5 Chief Minister Shankar Pokhrel and other provincial ministers.
The cooperative collects 4,000 to 5,000 litres of milk every day. “We can’t stop buying milk from the farmers,” the cooperative’s chairman Tilak Ram Ghimire says, “So, instead of throwing it away, we distribute it free now onwards, incurring loss to ourselves.”
It is estimated that the loss amounts to Rs 50,000 per day.
He informs that the cooperative is coordinating with Sainamaina municipality for distribution."

Rautahat, April 20
A 25-year-old man has been found murdered in Katahariya of Rautahat district in southern Nepal on Sunday night.
The victim has been identified asa Sanjeev Yadav, a local of Hanuman Tole, Katahariya municipality-1. Police suspect that he was beaten up severely.
Earlier at around 10 pm yesterday, a local of his neighbourhood had reportedly called the victim out and taken away. After a while, he was found severely injured. Yadav then was rushed to Birgunj for treatment but died on the way.
The District Police Office says he has critical injuries on his head and chest.
The police had arrested Radhe Das, who reportedly took Yadav along with him. Further investigation is underway, according to SP Ravi Raj Khadka, the chief of the DPO."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Birgunj, April 20
Police in Birgunj city of Parsa district have arrested a man on the charge of murdering his seven-year-old daughter.
The suspect has been identified as Sanjaya Kumar Sah Sonar, 29, a resident of Chhapkaiya, Birgunj-1 of the district. DSP Birendra Bahadur Shahi, the spokesperson of the District Police Office, says, “It has been revealed that he strangled his daughter, Anshu Kumari, and later faked that it was a suicide.”
The child was found dead in a room of her house on March 24 afternoon. The police were immediately informed about the incident saying the child killed herself by hanging with a shawl on a nail on the wall. It had been reported that the father saw her hanging and rushed her to the Narayani Sub-regional Hospital, which declared her dead upon arrival.
However, police investigations concluded that the father killed her, according to DSP Shahi. Following that, the suspect was arrested last Thursday.
Nonetheless, the investigators say the father did not have any intention to kill her; he had pressed her throat just to threaten her against going out during the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus crisis.
It has been learned that the suspect already confessed to the crime."

It all started with a front-page story in Kantipur, a popular Nepali daily. The piece followed the life of a bear tamer in Siraha, who made a living by making a little bear dance for an audience as he wandered around the southeastern district each day. The reporter’s tone was sympathetic to the man and his poor living conditions, and the piece touched many of the paper’s readers.
For Sneha Shrestha, however, nothing could be more infuriating. “The first thing I wanted to do after reading the story was going with my team to Siraha to rescue the animal and free it from torture,” said Shrestha, who runs an animal welfare charity.
Her team travelled overnight from Kathmandu to rescue little Dhutharu, the one-year-old male sloth bear in a village near the district headquarters Lahan.
Named after sloths for their lethargy, sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) like Dhutharu are found in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Secretariat.
They are also listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.
Since NGOs like Sneha’s Care are not authorised to rescue wild animals themselves, Dhutharu was handed over to the government, with a request that he be transported to a wildlife recovery centre in India as Nepal does not have such a facility.
But, six months on, he is languishing inside a small cage in the country’s only zoo in Kathmandu. Government officials have dismissed repeated calls by Shrestha and other activists who urge that the bear be sent to India, on the pretext that the animal is Nepali property.
The activists argue that the government should not make an issue of the ‘nationality’ of an animal, primarily one that is wild by nature, when deciding where the animal should live.
Does wildlife have a ‘nationality’?
The debate surrounding Dhutharu’s fate exposes the government’s poor preparedness to deal with transboundary wildlife conservation, which has become a recurring issue for Nepali authorities.
The case follows the controversy during the transfer of Rangila, said to be ‘the last’ of Nepal’s dancing bears, to India in 2018.
Shrestha had hoped that the government would easily hand Dhutharu over to a wildlife sanctuary in India as Nepal had already sent two rescued ‘dancing bears’ to India in the last decade: the first in 2010 and the second in 2018.
Other animal rights activists agree with her. “We already have two precedents, hence sending the bear to India should not be an issue,” said Niraj Gautam, who was involved in the two earlier cases.
“But this case is different,” Gopal Prakash Bhattarai, the chief of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, told thethirdpole.net. “In the Rangila case (2018), the rescuers had documents that showed the bear came to the Nepali side from India. [In Dhutharu’s case] they do not have any such evidence. Hence, we do not entertain requests for repatriation.”
Gautam, who worked for the Jane Goodall Institute until a few months back, and led the rescue and repatriation of Rangila, recalled that repatriating the bear was not as easy as Bhattarai is now making it sound. Even then the department was not ready to listen to activists and left them no choice but to reach out to the political leadership.
“The decision to send Rangila was made during a cabinet meeting,” Gautam said, adding that activists had shared some ‘soft’ evidence at the time.
“We told them that the communities making bears dance are scarce in Nepal; even if a Nepali still does it, it is under the influence of the Indians; and mostly, such animals are rescued near the open border, so the animal must have belonged to India.”
Gautam explained that the tradition of dancing bears is unheard of in the hills and mountains of Nepal, and exists only in the southern plains that border India. In India, the practice is now illegal and is dying out.
The rarity of the practice drives media coverage, and these are always called ‘the last dancing bear’. Raju, rescued in Bangalore in 2009, and Rangila rescued nine years later in Nepal, were given similar titles.
In Dhutharu’s case, the tamer has told the Kantipur reporter that the bear is the last remaining member of a bear couple gifted to his grandmother from her Indian parents as part of the dowry. Dhutharu is likely the third or fourth generation of the bear couple’s family.
The ghost of Sridevi
Gautam highlighted another reason why the nationality issue should be dismissed.
He has seen how a dancing bear named Sridevi died in the central zoo in 2018. International animal rights organisations like World Animal Protection concur that Sridevi died because of the poor living conditions in the zoo. Gautam now fears the same tragedy may await Dhutharu.
After the death of Sridevi and the repatriation of Rangila, Dhutharu is the first bear to reside in the zoo. Nothing substantial has changed for the past two years.
“We can’t be sure, but we can suspect that Sridevi died because of negligence and lack of better care,” Gautam said. “Perhaps a sanctuary will have different conditions. A zoo is never the best option for conservation.”
Internationally, zoos are meant for exhibition and education, but sanctuaries provide wildlife a better environment.
For this reason, the two facilities cannot be considered alternatives to each other, said Carol Buckley, a wildlife conservation expert. “Zoos cage and chain wild animals such as bears and elephants – who normally travel miles each day – in unnatural and small exhibits, resulting in the animals’ psychological and physical breakdown,” she said. “The ultimate goal of a progressive sanctuary is rehabilitation and returning the animal to a healthy state of being.”
Corroborating Buckley’s explanation, Shrestha said that Dhutharu has been kept in a narrow cage that deprives him of free movement. She said the zoo rejected her offer of a bigger cage.
Chiranjibi Prasad Pokharel, Project Manager of the Central Zoo, was defensive. “Perhaps they [the critics] do not know the way we take care of the animals here. Nepal has already set many examples in wildlife conservation and we, at the zoo, also provide them the best possible care,” he told thethirdpole.net. “If we had not been serious about their welfare, why would have we rescued them in the first place? Our goal is to let the animals live a painless life.”
Pokharel, however, accepted that the zoo management has not been able to provide the best possible habitat to the animals for lack of space. The government frequently talks about expanding or relocating the zoo, but the plans never materialise, the official added.
A turbulent future
Although he agreed in principle that a zoo is not the best option for conservation, the department’s chief, Bhattarai, pledged that the government of Nepal will manage such cases in the future, so there is no need to hand animals over to foreign sanctuaries.
“The fifth amendment to the Wildlife Conservation Act three years ago has introduced the provision of establishing rescue and rehabilitation centres. Based on the law, the government is preparing to establish such centres in all seven provinces of the country,” he said.
The Wildlife Conservation Act is the law that regulates all wildlife affairs in the country, from governing zoos and national parks to efforts to control wildlife smuggling.  The amendment authorises not only the government but a private individual or institution to establish an animal rescue and rehabilitation centre after meeting certain criteria. However, the government is yet to formulate any regulation or guidelines that will facilitate implementation. “Everything will happen, but it will take time,” Bhattarai said. “You know we are a developing country.”
The same amendment also has a provision about gifting wild animals to foreign governments for the sake of their conservation and management. However, the law does not have any clause regarding the transfer of any animal to a foreign sanctuary.
Activists fear the problem will persist for many years. “The wildlife habitat is shrinking in Nepal, forcing many wild animals to come to the streets or to human settlements. In turn, we will rescue more such animals in the upcoming days,” Gautam said. “But because we [the nation as a whole] do not consider the issue of animal welfare seriously, they will suffer for life.”
The government has plenty of options to take care of such animals inside Nepal, added Gautam.
“They say there is no space, but it is not true. We can manage such animals in the Chitwan and Bardiya national parks,” he said, recalling that Rangila and Sridevi were kept in the Parsa National Park for a few weeks after they were rescued. However, he said, “It is sad that we do not have any provisions for that now.”
Bhattarai pointed out challenges. “There are many practical difficulties. You cannot just cram all the animals in one place together. They have different natural habitats and the forest areas we allocate should match that. We need to recruit skilled human resources including veterinarians,” he said, repeating, “Everything will happen, but it takes time.”
Meanwhile, claiming that Dhutharu’s health has improved since the rescue, the department is planning to release him from his narrow quarantine cage into a bigger cage for the exhibition.
For Shrestha, however, the bigger cage is also too congested for Dhutharu as four bears already live there.
“I wish I had sent Dhutharu to India before informing the government, [even if it meant I was put] behind bars for doing something I was not authorised to,” she said.

Owing to problems in the supply of vegetables and the fear of coronavirus infection in the ongoing lockdown, three temporary vegetable markets have come into operation in the capital from Sunday.
Authorities closed the vegetable markets in Kalimati and Balkhu for the retailers to avoid any fear of infection, informs Tejendra Paudel, Kalimati Fruit and Vegetable Development Board’s Executive Director.
Because the vegetable markets in Kalimati and Balkhu have become inaccessible to the retailers, the markets have begun in Kalanki, Baphal, and Swayambhu also.
Earlier, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had decided to open such markets in 11 places. However, the traders did not implement the decision citing various managerial problems.
In the newly established markets, not the traders, but the farmers in and around Kathmandu are selling the vegetables."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has urged the government to rescue and repatriate Nepalis who are currently in crisis due to the global coronavirus outbreak.
The party has requested the government to take back home its citizens who are stranded after being expelled from their job and whom the employers or hosting governments have not taken care of.
Issuing a statement on Sunday, the party also said the government should conduct health checkups of the citizens who are waiting at various Nepal-India border points and let them enter the country. Likewise, the government should help the workers who are walking to their houses from various urban areas after losing their jobs due to the lockdown, according to the party.
Meanwhile, the party has demanded that the government form an all-party mechanism to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has already rejected the idea.

The Nepal Academy is adding 12 new words related to the Covid-19 pandemic to the latest edition of its Nepali dictionary.
The academy’s dictionary is one of the most popular and credible dictionaries of the language.
The academy’s Chancellor Ganga Prasad Uprety says the academy is adding the words such as ‘lockdown’, ‘bandabandi’ (meaning ‘lockdown’ in Nepali), ‘human quarantining’ (because ‘quarantining’ was used for animals and plants only in Nepal in general), ‘social distancing’, ‘contact tracing’ and ‘PPE’ among others.
He says the new dictionary will be printed as soon as the lockdown will be over."

The Province 2 government has decided to take relief materials to each house of the needy if they are in problem due to the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak and are not able to come to relief distribution centres.
A meeting of the provincial council of ministers held on Sunday morning made the decision.
Earlier, the local governments had been distributing relief materials in their jurisdictions. Many local communities had expressed dissatisfaction over the process citing it was not fair and many privileged people also got the relief support. Considering the controversies, the provincial government made the decision to change the model.
Now onwards, District Cottage and Small-scale Industry Office will purchase the relief materials, pack them and provide to ward committees. The ward committees have been assigned to provide support to the needy’s house within the next 24 hours."

Internet service providers of the country have said they will not cut off connections to their consumers even if they fail to pay the bills due to lockdown restrictions only in specific cases.
They say the consumers who are old, alone at home and who have physical disabilities will have uninterrupted service during this period if they do not have anyone to assist them at home. Other consumers will have to pay the bills online, according to a decision made by the Internet Service Provider Association of Nepal.
Earlier, the government had urged the ISPs to provide the uninterrupted service during the lockdown even if the consumers fail to pay. In response to the instruction, the ISPAN wrote a letter to the Nepal Telecommunications Authority specifying its conditions for continuing the service.
The ISPAN president Bhoj Raj Bhatta says the ISPs decided to be selective as they also have to pay their staff working during this period."

Nepal’s health authorities on late Saturday evening confirmed the 31st coronavirus infection case in the country.
The Ministry of Health and Population says a 65-year-old man currently residing in Udayapur district has been infected. It has been learned that he was also residing at a mosque in Bhulke, Triyuga municipality of the district along with 12 others who got infected with the virus earlier.
Dr Basudev Pandey, the chief of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the ministry, says a lab test at Koshi Zonal Hospital confirmed the case today.
Just on Friday, 11 Indians and one Nepali residing there had been confirmed of the infection. The case confirmed Saturday is also said to be an Indian.
Among 31 confirmed cases, three have been already recovered including two patients discharged on Saturday."

The meeting concluded that the needy did not have access to the relief materials distributed currently, demanding the government ensure the speedy distribution, the party’s spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma informed the press after the meeting.
Meanwhile, the meeting also demanded that the government ensure that those leaving urban areas for their villages reach their destinations safely."
"
What is the context?
The government authorities seem content that people are obeying the lockdown regulations which keep on changing at the local level. The authorities believe that there is a positive correlation between the lockdown on the streets and public safety from the spread of the virus: the stricter the lockdown, the safer the population. The end of lockdown is not certain yet while the reports from the ground clearly show the lockdown effects – difficulty and hardship among farming communities, squatters, informal sector workers, the landless and the homeless who do not have access to any social security provisions.
The Covid-19 pandemic is creating an unprecedented economic and labour market shock.  Self-employed and wage earners from informal markets are at high risk of losing regular income as agriculture sector workers continue to be affected by the lockdown and movement restrictions. Agriculture Minister Ghanashyam Bhusal has recently issued a letter addressing the local governments suggesting how they can reduce the impact among local producers, farmers, and workers. He has also been lobbying not to shut down agricultural industries. However, he also fails to see the impact on street food and vegetable markets where thousands of families earn their living in rural and urban centres.
This situation will get further aggravated in the next few weeks as the cases are observed increasing in Kathmandu and in some Tarai districts. The disease has already shown its presence in both Tarai and mountainous districts where existing health systems are less equipped and less prepared to cope with the crisis. It is obvious that the virus spreads more rapidly among less equipped, and less prepared communities. Hence, immediate response measures are needed to address concerns of the underprivileged groups such as the landless, the homeless and wage workers.
The key elements to break the chain of the Covid-19 include adequate housing to maintain standard distance, a basket with fresh dietary foods, enough water, and soap to wash hands frequently and follow the standard respiratory practice. To employ and practice these protective measures as recommended by the WHO sounds too ideal for more than 80 per cent of the population in Nepal. So the recommended practices of self-protection can hardly be maintained in existing housing and settlement in both rural and urban areas in Nepal.
Hence, some policies and practical considerations to be taken into account to curb the spread of the coronavirus are presented below:
Focus on actual rather than the perceived crisis
The pandemic could be the turning point for human history and the world could have a totally different world order after this. Right now, the pandemic has pushed the whole humanity to the brink of existing science, commerce and philosophy. In this context, whatever the scale of their vision, people have started analysing the situation using the coronavirus lens. Many people are loud enough to be heard talking about the situation how it was before and how it will be after. But, there are people already less audible who are facing the harsh reality – they represent the underprivileged group. They are the real stories that portray the crisis vividly during the crisis. Their needs are very important and should be prioritised by immediate policy measures, safety-nets and supporting mechanisms rather than only analysing the past and crafting the strategies for the future.
Maintain the agri-food supply chain
The agri-food supply chain demands incessant and frequent interaction among individuals, goods, and tools, which is significantly disrupted. Thousands of agricultural entrepreneurs and small producers, as well as the street traders, are under the lockdown and their mobility is heavily curtailed providing farmers, agri-traders and street vendors a heavy toll. On one hand, people in the urban areas hardly find fresh vegetables, meat and dairy products, compromising their basic food habit further jeopardising the immune system especially of children, pregnant and lactating women as well as the elderly. On the other hand, street traders and vendors could not come along the streets and sell their products ready for sale as the government has imposed the lockdown in cities with no alternative mechanism to maintain the food chain. This has not only affected the food chain but also disrupted the income, further exacerbating the livelihood prospectus of the street traders. People working in this sector may easily lose their job and be exposed to the virus as they can hardly maintain the mobility, standard physical distance, access to water and soap frequently to wash hands. The government needs to think of providing adequate safety tools timely and support maintaining the strong food chain to respond to the crisis.
Family farming needs to be promoted
Family farmers have been able to keep the supply of food possible intact in these difficult hours. They have very important roles to play to maintain the food availability for their family members and others. There are more than 70 per cent households practising agriculture in Nepal. Protecting and supporting them with adequate agri-inputs and market linkages will help the country respond to the food shock created by the lockdown. In Kathmandu and other urban centres, local producers are contributing to the supply of fresh vegetables and other food items while the majority of the supermarkets remain closed.
Return of migrant workers from India and other countries will disrupt the whole system
According to the current data, around four million Nepalis are overseas for employment. Besides, hundreds of thousands of people have gone to various Indian states for income as seasonal migrant workers. Host countries have already begun putting pressure on them to return to Nepal. They will not be able to remain there for a longer time. The pandemic has just begun to hit our foreign employment hubs; the countries will have no option put to request the government of Nepal to take back its people or to deport them soon, with or without reviewing the employment permits. But, the Nepal government is less prepared to cope with this shock. It may create immediate chaos and longer-term disturbance that may lead to the system collapse.
The underprivileged population should be safeguarded
An overwhelming majority of informal settlers, agricultural workers, wage labourers, street vendors, petty traders, agricultural labourers, landless and homeless people will have to face the worst difficulty ranging from the shortages of water, food and proper shelter during this lockdown in the initial phase of the spread of the crisis in healthcare and emergency support systems. The examples are already on the surface. A group of skilled mason workers residing nearby my residence continue to go to their work even in this lockdown period. They have to go so that they can earn to buy foodstuffs to feed their children. Three out of five in this group have their newborn babies and lactating mothers. In Kathmandu, there are 40 squatter communities hosting more than 800,000 people. Access to water, food, and income is extensively curtailed due to the lockdown in all informal settlements and squatters.
Haphazard housing and lack of proper land-use plan should be addressed
Households sharing a common water pipe and toilet is a huge problem in the fight against the pandemic in both rural and urban areas. Many people do not own land and they find difficulty in managing own toilets and have to share a common toilet. Socio-economic marginalization and unequal power relations further jeopardise the system. Access to water in Kathmandu is a big social problem as the metropolitan city supplies water once or twice a week. House owners and tenants share the water which is inadequate for drinking and cleaning.
The current scenario in the ground tells us that the shortage of water and food is currently the major challenge followed by the landlessness and homelessness among underprivileged communities. Any plan that includes the installation of water tanks, building additional toilets, providing safe tents or housing adequate for physical distancing, land titles over the land will be instrumental in solving the problem.
The government needs to start planning the strategies that need to be put in place now and later. This lockdown period can be an opportunity to reflect on key policies and strategies that the government has been using so far in protecting the rights and providing the services to the poor.

Some locals of Janak Nandini rural municipality in Dhanusha district, near Janakpurdham, on Saturday afternoon staged a demonstration, claiming the local authority distributed relief materials meant to support the underprivileged during the lockdown to others.
The locals of Mahuwa, ward 3 of the local government, claimed the ward committee distributed the materials to the privileged instead.
The irate locals came in front of the ward office and chanted slogans against the officials.
One of the protestors Anil Paswan says the locals resorted to the protest after they saw names of the rich in the neighbourhood on the list of beneficiaries prepared by the ward.
The ward chair Bisun Dev Sah, however, says the list was prepared in the consensus of all the political parties active there.
Following the protest, the ward committee has postponed the distribution."

The government-run electricity distribution monopoly, Nepal Electricity Authority, has requested its customers to pay the electricity bill online whenever possible.
The authority made the appeal after its failure to mobilise its employees to read metres at individual houses, coupled with a decrease in the consumption, resulted in a significant fall in its revenue collection. Consequently, the authority has been unable to manage costs for its daily functioning also.
“We have not been able to read metres in every house due to this hard time of lockdown,” the authority’s Managing Director Kul Man Ghising says, “But the customers can pay via authorised eight payment gateways the amount that they paid last month.”
Whenever the customers fail to pay this way also, the authority has decided that they will not be fined till mid-May, Ghising informs, adding, if the lockdown is extended again, this period will also be adjusted accordingly."

The teenage girl had returned to Nepal from France via Qatar on March 17 and she was diagnosed on March 23. The confirmation of infection in her had led the government to impose a complete lockdown across the country, which is still in effect.
Two other people who travelled on the same aircraft from Doha to Kathmandu that day have also been infected. The natives of Baglung district in western Nepal are undergoing treatment at Dhaulagiri Hospital there.

The Korean Language Test that the government would conduct every year in Nepal to send workers to South Korea under the Employment Permit System has been uncertain this year due to the global coronavirus crisis.
In the past years, the government would collect applications from the interested candidates in March-April. However, the process has not begun this year due to the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
The government has already received a confirmation from the Seoul government that it would recruit over 5,000 workers this year, informs Krishna Khanal, the director of EPS Korea Section in the Ministry of Labour and Employment. But, the government does not have any plan on how to move forward, according to him.
In the past years, the government would conduct the exams in the second week of June. However, no preparations have been made this year."

Twelve persons who have been confirmed of coronavirus infection in Udayapur district of eastern Nepal had been admitted to the newly established coronavirus-dedicated hospital in Biratnagar, the provincial capital.
The patients include 11 Indians and a Nepali. The Nepali man is a native of the Morang district.
Meanwhile, four other persons, who were with the patients but are not confirmed of the infection, have been quarantined in Tadi of Morang.
Officials in Udayapur had sent all the 16 persons to Biratnagar on Thursday. Udayapur Chief District Officer Deepak Kumar Pahadi says the hospital did not admit the four persons, hence they were quarantined separately.
“Yes, we did not admit them because they were not infected,” Dr Sangita Mishra, the medical superintendent of Koshi Hospital, which manages the new hospital, says, “When we keep the non-patients in the hospitals, what should we do when there are new patients?”"

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Authorities in various districts around Kathmandu have begun stopping people walking on the streets on their way home from urban areas including Kathmandu during the lockdown.
Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had directed the authorities to strictly enforce the lockdown restrictions in the wake of the growing number of coronavirus infection cases.
Before this, scores had been leaving Kathmandu after being deprived of their jobs during the lockdown. Many trucks and other vehicles had also transported some of them.
But, with the prime minister’s instructions, security personnel in Kavre, Dhading and Chitwan districts among others have stopped dozens of walks. “We have barred anyone from walking on the streets except in emergency cases,” Kavre Chief District Officer Shrawan Kumar Timalsina says, “A few people come, but we have been stopping them wherever they arrive in coordination with local authorities.”
He says the district officials are coordinating with their counterparts in the Kathmandu Valley to stop them within the valley.
The prime minister’s directive had come just a few hours after the Supreme Court had ordered the government to help such walkers reach their destinations safely. The government had been told to arrange transportations for them. However, the government did not heed it."

On April 2, Kavita Chapagain went online with her first-ever podcast titled ‘Hope’. Using her love for books and her dream of being an RJ, she started her podcast with her own name and spoke about the hope that one needed during the lockdown with excerpts from Subin Bhattarai’s ‘Priya Sufi’. With just two episodes so far, she already has over 300 listeners. A social worker by profession, she says she loves the process and also the feedback coming her way.
Similarly, just two days before the lockdown was announced, Psychbigyaan Network Nepal, went live on its YouTube channel and started the PNN Podcast series that addresses different psychological issues that people may face during the pandemic situation while combating the virus from their homes. The podcast is run by Kripa Sigdel and Sujan Shrestha, and their first episode was on how people were taking the situation and their psychological behaviours in general.
There are many others like Chapagain, Sigdel, and Shrestha as the lockdown has provided them enough time and opportunity to explore their talents and expressions.
Hopping on hopes
New podcasters, Sigdel and Shrestha say they thought podcasts would be a better platform to make people aware. “As we are suffering from this pandemic and under a lockdown, we could not ignore the mental toll on people’s psyche. People’s social behaviour is an instrumental factor that either increases or stops the spread of the coronavirus,” Sigdel views, “The gravity of the situation demanded a quick and efficient way to make people aware of the issue, and we chose the podcast.”
“Our focus is to help youth, parents, officials, frontline [health] workers, migrant workers, etc with their mental state. We are trying to encompass messages of awareness, self-control, ways to control our intense emotions such as fear, and how to build and foster relationships while maintaining the physical distance,” she explains, “We hope it will help people to reflect upon their behaviours, thoughts, and actions to make an informed decision regarding their mental health during this unprecedented situation.”
For Chapagain, it is about the potential of the platform to practise her communication skills taking advantage of the time at hand, to learn where she lacks and to better her skills for the field as she closely works with children. Inspired by another podcast ‘My Emotions Matter’, she also thinks of podcasts as a good way to express.
“Many are posting on social media that they are bored; they are in search of something to do. I believe podcasts can be a good platform to engage, learn new things, utilise the time in their hands, and break the monotony they are facing,” says Chapagain, who shares book reviews, motivational advice and quotes that she likes in hope to help those overwhelmed by the virus spread.
Emerging economist and entrepreneur Surath Giri also took this opportunity to launch his podcast. “I had always wanted to start a podcast on economics in Nepal because there was none. My work and other engagements always prevented me,” he says, “Thanks to this lockdown, I had some free time at my hand. So I started it targeting anyone who wants to learn principles of economics and their application in our daily life in an interesting way.”
Proved potential
Hopes shared by Sigdel, Chapagain, and Giri are the ones that led many promising podcasters to launch their shows in the past. Pioneer Nepali podcaster and RJ Sabeena Karki started ‘Yo Maya Bhanne Cheej Kasto Kasto’ [SABSCAST] in 2016, which became an extension of her radio programme. She started it with the objective to channelise her radio listeners and to create a buzz about podcasts in Nepal while continuing what she loved to do. She saw potential in the sector and has been hosting multiple training sessions and workshops to actively promote and change the space.
Likewise, ‘The Doers’ by The Doers Nepal that started in 2019 also capitalised on the new opportunities it saw. “In terms of entrepreneurship and startups, there were no specific platforms from where I could get information. For the same reason, we now invite a lot of young people taking new initiatives in different domains so that it can actually set an example for the younger generation.”
Another example is ‘Mero2Paisa’ [My Two Cents] started in 2018 by DropOut Media and Events Pvt. Ltd. in which the podcasters share issues related to society, entrepreneurship, spirituality and the ways of life in general. With the podcast, the producers intend to make an impact on the younger generation with stories coming directly from the guests and their experiences.
Such stories also became an important part of two American nationals in Nepal who joined the wagon in 2018 with ‘Big and White: Life as a Foreigner in Nepal’. While many governments have evacuated their citizens from Nepal, these two who identify themselves as Big and White are still here, podcasting.
Easy medium
Both old and new podcasters say they resorted to podcasting because it is flexible and the market is welcoming. They feel the platform is easily accessible and, with the medium’s promotion in recent years, they have reached many of the listeners. Starting a podcast is also very easy and requires minimum to no expenses to start.
“Hosting platforms like Anchor allow one to start a podcast for free, and also distributes your podcast to all the major podcasting platforms: it is very easy,” shares The Doers team.
Also, unlike videos, podcasts do not demand constant attention; information can be consumed passively or even while multitasking. It also allows listeners to binge-listen to their favourite episodes as well as pause and resume or play as per one’s desired speed.
However, the podcasters say podcasting requires a lot of research and appropriate preparations as they have to speak on a certain topic for as long as an hour or converse with a certain expert of any field.
As podcasters work with a niche group and target their niche audience, it can only gain a regular audience with specific interests in the topic; and research is a must in order to retain it.
Focus on positivity and preparedness
Based on such research, both new and old podcasters say they want to spread positivity among their audiences in their time of crisis with their podcasts. Some of them aim at preparing the audiences for the likely challenges.
“People are obviously talking about their fears, feelings of being homesick, the lackluster response from our government, and also sharing how irritated they have become of their partners since they are now together 24/7,” Karki says, “But the good part is that I am getting a lot more positive messages from people saying that they are discovering new things about their family members. They share there are more conversations with less judgement and biases among them.” She views that other podcasters should also promote such beliefs among their audiences.
Mero2Paisa is taking this opportunity to give its listeners ideas about how this pandemic will change the world in terms of economy and finances. “This will help people speculate the kind of future there is to come and help them get ready for it.”
Similarly, The Doers Nepal believes this is an opportunity to be apt for businesses and people to discuss pros and cons of different business modalities and their alternatives, as the Covid-19 has highly affected every sector.
Sustainability of the growing family
The new podcasters born during this lockdown have become members of the Nepali podcasting community that is already growing. Seeing many already in the field and getting compliments from the listeners, the new podcasters find their journey exciting and promising.
Showing many screenshots he received from his listeners, Giri says, “I have been getting amazing responses. I am kind of overwhelmed. The audience has really liked the storytelling and simple explanation of economic concepts in a way that everyone can relate to.”
Their predecessors also seem excited. One between Big and White says, “It is proof of their willingness to share their voices and opinions and democratise them in Nepal.”
Karki, from her experiences, says that the zeal factor is most important in a podcaster to start. “If it is a job well begun, it is half done. But, you have to prepare yourself to produce about 20 episodes, enough for a year. During this time, make sure to not look at the ratings or comments.” She also recommends that the podcasters also rightly use the platforms made for podcasting, not YouTube.
Likewise, others recommend various measures to ensure sustainability. Mero2Paisa team stresses the importance of having one’s niche sorted out, usually something that one is passionate and knowledgeable about. The Doers team recommends continuing working relentlessly for a significant time to see any result."

The government has directed internet service providers not to cut off connections even if the consumers fail to pay their bills due to lockdown restrictions.
Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulatory body of the sector in Nepal, issued the directive as there are complaints that some ISPs cut off the connections during the time of crisis.  The use of the internet has significantly increased of late as most of the people have been restricted inside their house.
Citing that it is not possible for the people to visit counters to make payments, the authority has also directed the service providers to launch online payment systems as soon as possible.
Even if the consumers fail to pay this way, the companies should provide their service uninterrupted and collect the fees after the lockdown without charging fines, according to the authority."

The Province 5 government is preparing to help the people who have been stranded in the province or who are currently in the province on their journey to certain places due to lockdown restrictions.
The government has assured that it will help them reach their destinations safely, by ensuring food and shelter before that. However, they will be quarantined before taken home.
Chief Minister Shankar Pokhrel on Friday directed the authorities not to leave anyone stranded anywhere in the province, but to quarantine them with basic facilities. Once the lockdown will be over, they will be sent home safely, according to the chief minister’s press coordinator Sher Bahadur KC.
He says the provincial government will coordinate with concerned local units to facilitate this process, adding the government has already allocated budget to the local units to arrange quarantine facilities."

The main opposition party, Nepali Congress, has expressed its concerns over the suffering of workers and daily wage earners due to lockdown restrictions.
After losing jobs due to the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country, many have lost their jobs. For want of sufficient food and money to stay in their current locations, they have been leaving for their houses on foot despite travel restrictions.
In this context, the party’s president Sher Bahadur Deuba urged the government to make arrangements to take them home safely. On his Twitter page, Deuba commented that the government had become a mute spectator of their pain.
Meanwhile, the party’s spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma asked on his Facebook page, on Friday, “Do the workers walking on the streets have any government in this country? Why should one die of hunger after surviving the coronavirus?”
The party has called a meeting of the party’s office-bearers in Kathmandu on Saturday. Sharma says the leaders will discuss how the party can play its role actively in this time of crisis."

Energy secretaries of Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and Bhutan have held an online meeting to discuss the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the energy sector of the region.
Nepal’s Energy Secretary Dinesh Kumar Ghimire says they discussed the balance between electricity demand and supply, under-construction hydropower projects, the problems they faced, and possible solutions.
During the meeting, Nepal proposed forming a joint company for the construction of the Butwal-Gorakhpur 400 KV transmission line between Nepal and India, according to him. He urged his Indian counterpart, Sanjeev Nandan Sahai, to sign a shareholder agreement as soon as possible.
Likewise, Nepal also requested India to facilitate the transport of some equipment purchased by Nepali hydropower projects as they got stuck in India due to the lockdown in both the countries. Recently, the cabinet has decided that the hydropower projects continue their works during the lockdown also, he informed."

Weeks after annulling an agreement for the purchase of medical supplies required in the country’s Covid-19 response, the government of Nepal signed agreements with three companies.
The Department of Health Services on Friday signed the agreements to import necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) sets, N-95 masks, surgical masks, and other supplies within the next two weeks.
“In total, the value of these agreements is around Rs 300 million. The companies given the contracts are Om Surgical, Hamro Medi Concern, and Lumbini Healthcare,” the department’s chief Mahendra Prasad Shrestha informs. Five companies had applied for the contracts, according to him.
The companies have pledged to supply some of the equipment next week and all of them in the second week.
The department is planning to sign another agreement to purchase the lab equipment. It will be signed in the next two days, according to Bhogendra Raj Dotel, the director of the Management Division in the department.
Likewise, there will be another agreement for the purchase of sanitiser, and thermometres.
Meanwhile, the government has also assigned the Nepal Army to purchase the necessary medical equipment. The army, however, has not begun procedures to implement the assignment."

Various private businesses of Nepal have been continuously ferrying medical supplies from China for the country’s Covid-19 response.
Two wide-body aircraft of the national flag carrier, Nepal Airlines Corporation, landed in Kathmandu on Friday morning, carrying various equipment from the agencies.
The aeroplanes had left for Guangzhou of China on Thursday afternoon.
Whereas the government has not been able to efficiently import the medical supplies required to test people for the infection, and treat them, the private agencies have expedited their activities.
Meanwhile, one of the two aeroplanes landed in Kathmandu this morning overshot the runway, according to an official of the NAC. “Maybe the pilot got confused somehow. However, it is absolutely normal,” the official says.

Kathmandu, April 17
The government is preparing to make all schools across the country publish their final examination results upto grade 9 in one week after the end of the lockdown. However, it has been revealed that most of the private schools in Province 2 are yet to conduct the exams.
In early April, the government had issued a notice directing the schools to complete the final examinations by March 18. Accordingly, most schools completed the exams by then and closed the classes while keeping the result publication pending. But the schools in Province 2 are yet to conduct the exams, according to Mahendra Mahato, an undersecretary at Education Division of the Provincial Ministry of Social Development.
The government-run community schools, however, have completed the examinations as per the directive.
The president of Private and Boarding Schools Organisation Nepal (PABSON) Province 2 Committee, Murari Prasad Sah, assures that the schools will take conduct the examinations when the government schedules the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE). He says the government notice did not give the schools sufficient time to prepare for the examinations."

After recovering from the COVID-19, she spent the Easter holiday happily with her family. Neupane, a registered nurse at Northern Hospital Epping located in Melbourne, in a short conversation with the Onlinekhabar opened up, “My husband here in Australia took good care of my daughters and me, and my parents and my friends from Nepal constantly contacted me and helped me in maintaining high morale. I am grateful to each of them.”
From transmission to treatment
She, along with her family, arrived in Melbourne from New York on March 22 after a 24-hour flight. On the next day, she felt a bit uneasy. So, she with her family underwent tests for the virus.
By March 26, the reports of the tests of her family were already out and fortunately, all of them tested negative. But, her report was delayed and it left her in stress.
She shares, “Later, I was contacted by the Health Department and the hospital. They informed me that I had tested positive for the virus and consoled me to not get traumatised and to stay in isolation at home, away from the family.” They also assured that they would provide an isolation facility if there was any problem with space for isolation.
But, she decided to stay in isolation at home. Being a health worker herself, she was very conscious as to not induce any negative psychological impact on her husband and daughters.
She said that she was contacted on the telephone several times daily by the health department, the doctors who have been looking after her and the hospital where she has been working. She confirms, “This provided me a lot of psychological support.”
“In isolation, I paid proper attention to my daily diet. I adequately drank lemon water mixed with turmeric which used to be bitter in taste and did physical exercises along with yoga regularly.” She also says that she had spent her isolation period being constantly updated with government notices and policies regarding the coronavirus.
She was pre-informed that on the seventh and the eighth days, it might get a little harsh. She felt the same. But, with patience, she tackled her sufferings successfully.
She was to return to her work, as soon as her isolation period was to end and she recovers. So she underwent the swab test several times. In the second test, it was found that the infection was still there. However, the latter two swab tests revealed that she had fully recovered from the disease. She cheers, “I am now completely free from the virus.”
Experience and expression
On Facebook, she has updated her profile photo with a frame that reads, “I am a health worker, I can’t stay home” happily informing that she has now returned to her work after recovery.
She asserts that she has received admiration and respect from her workplace family and the Melbourne neighbourhood. Meanwhile, she also remarks, “The attitude of society towards the one who is once infected with the coronavirus might be negative as well, so one also should be careful of such behaviours.”
She shared in an interview with local My Nepal TV in Australia that she had received great support and goodwill from Nepali social organisations and neighbours, mentioning, “The first moment after my recovery, reading a letter written in verses by my daughter, Palpasa, made me very emotional and I spent most of my time keeping her on my lap.”
Neupane recites the letter written by the eight-year-old:
“Mom, when will coronavirus go away from us?
And, when will I get to hug you?
When will I get to kiss you?
And, when can I sleep on your warm lap?
As your promise while we were in the US,
When do I get to go to the market with you?
And, when can I buy a bunny for Easter?”
Neupane tells Onlinekhabar, “My daughter had made me vow to go to the market with me and buy the [Easter] bunny and other things after arriving in Australia. But, even after defeating the coronavirus, we could not buy a bunny for her this time as the markets are all shut down. When the condition improves and markets open, I will fulfil that promise for my daughter.”
Status of other Nepalis in Australia
The Nepali Embassy in Canberra has informed that all the Nepalis who had been infected with the coronavirus in various Australian states have been cured now.
A 20-year-old Nepali student who arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, on February 26 via Singapore from Nepal showed symptoms somewhat similar to that of coronavirus infection including cold and cough on the following day of arrival.
But, the student came in contact with the health hotline only on March 6. The test conducted after that showed the infection. It was the first coronavirus infection case seen among the Nepali-Australians.
The news of the second coronavirus infection in the Nepali society in Australia was discovered in the third week of March. It was seen in a Nepali female nurse working in a nursing home in New South Wales. As per the advice of health workers, she remained in isolation, and now she has been recovered and returned to her regular routine.
The third report of the infection was from Victoria; it was Neupane’s case. According to a source in the Consulate General of Nepal in Victoria, another Nepali woman was examined on March 26 after she was suspected of the coronavirus infection. She too tested positive and that became the fourth case.
On March 26, the fifth report came out: another woman suspected of having a coronavirus infection at a settlement in New South Wales tested positive. Three other women who lived with her also underwent their tests immediately, and two of them tested positive for the coronavirus infection while the other one tested negative. Those three infected were kept in isolation in their own home whereas the other in whom the infection was not seen was kept away from them.
Until now, only Sanjita Neupane Bastakoti, the Nepali nurse based in Melbourne, originally belonging to Tandi of Chitwan in Nepal, has revealed her identity. She feels that as being a health worker, it is her responsibility to promote awareness regarding the coronavirus and that is why she has revealed her identity."

The government of Qatar has denied a charge made by the international human rights organisation, Amnesty International, that it expelled many Nepali workers in the name of testing them for the coronavirus infection.
The organisation on Wednesday had said it had interviewed 20 Nepali men who told that the Qatari police detained them in March saying they were being tested for the virus, but expelled them to Nepal after several days.
However, the Qatari government’s Communications Office says, “The individuals were repatriated to their country of citizenship in accordance with Qatar’s legal system.”
It informs, “During routine inspections as part of the government’s coronavirus control measures, officials uncovered individuals engaged in illegal and illicit activity. This included the manufacture and sale of banned and prohibited substances, along with the sale of dangerous food goods that could seriously threaten the health of people if consumed.”
The government has also denied keeping the workers in appalling conditions in detention centres, saying, “The State of Qatar treats all who are arrested or detained in our country with respect, dignity, and humanity in line with international standards.”
Meanwhile, the statement accuses Amnesty of being biased against Doha. “Since the start of the coronavirus global pandemic, Amnesty International has committed a disproportionate amount of time and resources to make unfounded allegations against Qatar. They consistently distort the reality of the public health response and fail to acknowledge the numerous measures introduced to protect the wellbeing of citizens and residents. “"

Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada says he had not imagined the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak would last such long, suggesting the government is not well-prepared to recover its financial impact anytime soon.
However, a hopeful Khatiwada claims the government would be able to devise appropriate strategies in partnership with the stakeholders including international donor agencies, banks and financial institutions, and private businesses.
In an interaction with representatives of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries in Kathmandu on Thursday, Khatiwada said, “We thought the period of infection risk would not be such long. We thought we would not enter into another phase (of lockdown). Once the lockdown has been extended for the second phase, it seems the problems will increase.”
“But some of our sectors can go for recovery immediately once the risk of coronavirus infection decrease,” he stated, “Agriculture, construction, and manufacturing to some extent will move forward immediately. It will take time for foreign tourists to come, but the internal tourism activities will surge once the situation is normal because people will be tired of staying home for months.”
Khatiwada informed that he had directed banks and businesses also prepare accordingly.
Meanwhile, the minister assured that the government would help the industrialists address their concerns such as paying salaries to the workers and insurance to the banks."

The Supreme Court on Thursday told the government to rescue and repatriate the Nepalis who are at risk abroad due to the global coronavirus crisis.
A single bench of Justice Sapana Pradhan Malla issued an interim order on Thursday in response to a writ petition filed by advocate Som Prasad Luintel.
However, the court has also maintained that bringing in all the Nepalis without any control and management could put the people here at risk, hence sufficient precautions should be maintained to keep everyone safe and healthy. Therefore, the court has suggested a rescue with ‘conditions and restrictions of control and regulation’."

In one month from March 14 to April 12, the government collected only 33 per cent of the customs duty estimated for that month, informs the Department of Customs.
The country’s import and export activities have been hit hard after the government imposed a lockdown to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country on March 23.
The department’s chief Suman Dahal says the department had set a target of Rs 36 billion in customs duty in the month but collected only around Rs 12 billion. After the lockdown started, the department collected Rs 2 billion only.
During the lockdown, the country mostly imported vegetables, petroleum products, and medicines, on which the customs charges are nominal, according to him.
Whereas 20 customs offices across the country collected revenues, Janakpur Customs Office recorded a transaction of zero rupees."

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner’s Office has taken action against a police officer after the personnel under his command reportedly beat up three doctors who were returning home from their hospital in Kathmandu.
DSP Umesh Lamsal has been removed from his duty and called back to the commissioner’s office in Ranipokhari as a punishment after the personnel from the Metropolitan Police Circle in Maharajgunj assaulted the doctors of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital last night.
The chief of the office, DIG Bishwa Raj Pokharel, says Lamsal has been removed from the position for investigation.
Meanwhile, the office also formed a three-member team led by SSP Kiran Bajracharya to look into the case. SP Mukesh Singh and DSP Hobindra Bogati are other members of the team.
The panel has been told to complete its assignment and submit the report as soon as possible."

Birgunj city in Province 2, where three Covid-19 patients were found earlier this week, is unlikely to begin testing people for coronavirus in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method before next week.
The province’s Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut had assured beginning the test in Birgunj on Tuesday. However, he failed to keep his words.
A PCR test machine has arrived in the city, but the test cannot begin now due to the lack of other equipment needed, according to health workers here.
“Thanks to the provincial and federal governments, we received the machine,” Dr Madan Upadhyaya, the medical superintendent of Narayani Sub-regional Hospital, says, “But other tools and equipment required for its operation have not been managed yet. We are working on that.”
“The tools and equipment are not easily available in the market. There are a few who import it. Further, they are costly,” he clarifies, “We cannot bring them all immediately. If they are managed, we can begin the test in the next seven days.”"

As different groups of Nepalis living abroad have demanded that the government evacuate them to the homeland during the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the government has finally begun collecting data about the citizens who are in grave problems due to the crisis.
In particular, the Ministry of Labour and Employment has begun collecting data about the migrant workers stranded due to the crisis, according to the ministry’s spokesperson Suman Ghimire. He says the information about the Nepalis who need immediate humanitarian assistance is being collected via concerned Nepali diplomatic agencies.
Once the detailed information is collected, the government will take an appropriate decision, according to him. “Maybe we can rescue, or maybe we can manage them differently,” he says, “We will make efforts to address their concerns.”
The government has estimated that around 100,000 workers need either repatriation or other management options.
Officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have also said they are also trying to assess the situation. However, it will be almost impossible to repatriate all of them, according to the ministry.
Various embassies have already begun sending the data to the ministry. They are under pressure as various countries had begun ordering the undocumented workers to leave the countries."

Speakers of the provincial assemblies of all provinces have commented that the coordination among federal, provincial and local units of the government is weak in controlling the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
When the National Assembly Chairman Ganesh Prasad Timilsina hosted a video conference among them on Wednesday, the provincial legislative leaders urged Timilsina to put pressure on the concerned agencies to consolidate the cooperation for effective implementation of the programmes conducted to control the outbreak.
“The governments at three levels are not on the same page in this fight,” Gandaki Speaker Netra Nath Adhikari said as Province 5 Speaker Purna Bahadur Gharti added, “The federal government wants to work through the chief district officers whereas the provincial governments pick their own representatives. The CDOs don’t want to obey provincial and local governments whereas the provincial governments also want to bypass them.”"

Kathmandu, April 16
The main opposition Nepali Congress has objected to the government’s decision to form a commission to solve the problems of landless squatters in the country.
The party says the government is busy giving jobs to cadres of the ruling party instead of solving current problems even in this time of the global coronavirus crisis.
A Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday had formed the commission under the leadership of Devi Gyawali, a leader of the ruling party in Chitwan district.
“Avoiding its responsibilities for the people,” the main opposition party’s chief whip in the House of Representatives, Bal Krishna Khand, says in a statement today, “It seems the government intends to politically manage the people close to it and give them some jobs by forming various commissions at this time of crisis.”
Khand claims all stakeholders have supported the government in coronavirus outbreak control, but it is not serious."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Despite continuous protest, the MCC was passed by the House of Representatives this year.
The government is spending the budget on acquiring land for road and transmission line projects.
Out of the budget set for this year, Rs 8.91 billion will be US grant and Rs 365.6 million will be spent by the government of Nepal. Most of the money for this project is spent on capital purposes."
"
The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

The West Bengal state government in India has unilaterally closed the Nepal-India border point at Kakarbhitta, a major eastern border point of Nepal, in its bid to prevent the coronavirus outbreak in the state.
The state government made the decision not only without consulting the Nepali counterpart, but it also goes against the Indian central government’s directive.
Mechi Customs Office chief Dhruva Raj Bishwakarma says, “Officials across the border have informed me that the Bengal government sent a letter to the customs office, informing the border has been closed indefinitely.” Accordingly, Indian customs officials are preparing to reroute the consignments via other border points, according to him.
The border closure will deprive Nepal of receiving the supplies from Bangladesh and Bhutan also.
Meanwhile, the Department of Customs in Kathmandu says it has taken note of the recent development, stating efforts have already begun to solve the problem.
A letter has been sent to the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Supplies demanding that solution to the problem."

Kathmandu, April 16
Army officials in the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre (CCMC) have begun searching for 60,000 sim cards sold just before the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak started in Nepal.
With this, the officials want to trace the people who have recently come to Nepal to check them for the coronavirus.
An official involved in the investigation says Nepal Telecom has submitted the centre a list of 20,000 new sim card numbers whereas Ncell submitted another list of 40,000. The sim cards were sold in one week immediately before the lockdown began.
As of Wednesday, the officials contacted 8,822 sim cardholders. Around 25 people have been involved in the process.
Though the details of those coming to Nepal on air can be collected from the airport, there is not any reliable source to give details of those coming via land. Hence, the sim card analysis has begun, according to the officials.
Meanwhile, the officials are clueless about what to do for those who do not receive the calls. The number of people not receiving the calls is also significant.
The officials are also tracing the people contacted by the coronavirus-infected persons. Meanwhile, Nepal Police and Ministry of Health are also tracing the contacts separately."

We are limiting all our available resources before the Covid-19 pandemic hits the country. While counting the total Covid-19 patients to 16, we have already had lockdown for three weeks. Thus, we can honestly question our resources and preparations when it reaches the climax.
The Government of Nepal has extended the lockdown for 12 days. A further extension will certainly increase the hardship of citizens. Is introducing the ‘pandemic emergency’ for a period of time an answer to this hardship?
The government should also introduce tools to maintain social and economic activities. It may provide a certain degree of ease in the daily life of lockdown-suffered citizens, at the same time checking the transmission of the disease. A significant increase of Covid-19 cases can be documented during the period of emergency, which can help policymakers to reevaluate the government’s strategy. It can bring effective lockdown into action.
Epidemiologists, clinicians and public health experts strongly recommend social distancing and practicing hygienic measures to flatten the curve of Covid-19 pandemic. How social distancing can be effectively implemented is at the crux of current discussions. Based on their own need and unique situation, governments of various countries are adopting different strategies in containing the pandemic. A strict lockdown per se is very effective to slow down the speed of transmission and therefore to flatten the pandemic curve, thus helpful in ensuring the health services are not overwhelmed by the infected cases in a high number.
However, there should be some emergency measures that will provide a much-needed window period to the lockdown-fatigued citizens to gather some motivation and strength, physically and psychologically. Remember, the harsh conditions of the lockdown should not break us emotionally and psychologically, but we should break the pandemic. We should remain prepared for it.
I am aware of the risks and challenges of this pandemic. What makes me concerned is we do not understand this disease clearly yet and the vaccine is so far. This pandemic is going to teach us a lot in the months to come. But one may say, at this time, we do not have any curve to flatten in Nepal which requires the lockdown.
We should not forget that a long span of lockdown will certainly have short and long-term implications over the health of the population. Just having Covid-19 patients in a less number is not enough to preserve the health of the citizens. In addition, economic activities and health are interconnected. Today’s need is all about taking a calculative and balanced action in combating this pandemic. Whichever approach we follow, we should act as one country and one government. The government, Nepali communities, governmental institutions and health workers of Nepal should work hand in hand in winning the war against Covid-19.

The Madhes-centric Rastriya Janata Party Nepal has demanded that the government tighten security measures along the Nepal-India border so as to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
The party’s statement comes when the number of infected cases is increasing in India. Recently, one person who had reportedly crossed the border violating the lockdown restrictions has tested positive for the virus in the bordering district of Rautahat in Nepal also.
The party’s chief Sharad Singh Bhandari issued a statement today demanding that additional security personnel be mobilised to control the likely crisis in Nepal.
The party has long been accused of maintaining its silence over various crucial issues related to India. Though the party urged the government to tighten security along the border today also, it has not mentioned ‘India’ in the statement."

The meeting also directed the government to expand the range of coronavirus tests and ensure that all the quarantined would get basic facilities properly.
The committee concluded that the government should ensure easy availability of treatment for the patients besides coronavirus infected and provide psychological counselling to those who fear the infection."

Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwa has said he has not visited Sun City Apartments, where two residents have been found to be infected with the coronavirus, in Kathmandu.
Khatiwada’s son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter also live on an apartment there and some media had reported that Khatiwada attended a function there a few weeks back.
But, the minister’s press coordinator Yaman Paudel has clarified that he has not visited any place except the Finance Ministry and the office of the high-level coronavirus control committee in Singhadarbar and the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar from his residence in Pulchok.
Paudel claims Khatiwada has diabetes and some heart problem also, hence he has been cautious about any infection even before the current crisis.
“At other times also, he used to leave events hosted at five-star hotels after his address without drinking even a cut of tea,” Paudel says."

Kageshwari Manohara municipality’s mayor Krishna Hari Thapa says the test has begun at 9:30 this morning. Those having other health issues, and senior citizens have been prioritised, according to him.
Now, they will undergo rapid diagnostic tests. Those testing positive in this phase will be tested as per the polymerase chain reaction also."

The Provincial Assembly in Province 5 has sent back Rs 86.4 million to the provincial government, requesting to spend it on Covid-19 response.
The Assembly Secretariat send back the money to the Ministry of Financial Affairs and Planning on Tuesday.
The government had allocated Rs 331.77 million to the legislative for this year. However, the assembly has not been able to spend the money sufficiently as no meetings have been held for the past three weeks due to the lockdown. Likewise, some other programmes also could not be held, hence the budget was returned, according to the Assembly Secretary Durlabh Kumar Pun.
Earlier, the secretariat had deposited Rs 2.33 million into the provincial government’s disaster management and treatment fund by deducting salaries of Speaker Purna Bahadur Gharti, Deputy Speaker Krishna Tharu, assembly members and staffers."

Previously, the day would be an opportunity to look back and review your overall achievements and failures of the past year and ponder planning afresh for the whole year. But, when the whole world is traumatised by the fear of the spread of deadly coronavirus disease, the Nepalis are also not untouched by its impacts. They are all occupied with news updates and worried about how to stay safe and healthy.
Consequently, they felt something different this New Year. Many felt it more boring than the previous years whereas a few also felt blissful to have time for themselves.
Celebration edged by crisis
Generally, to mark the beginning of a year, people go picnics or other kinds of outing with family and friends or invite extended family and friends to home, participate in traditional jatras, attend parties and concerts. But there is nothing this year. Everyone is at home, isolated, socially distancing oneself, locked down.
But when the whole nation is on complete lockdown, security personnel like police and army, media persons, health workers, and other daily essential goods suppliers are serving the rest of the public from the frontline. One of them is Police Inspector Rukh Bahadur Khadka, currently posted at Khanikhola Area Police Office in Dhading district. While others could not celebrate the New Year due to the coronavirus fears, he could not because he was on duty. Moreover, the government requires him to work more to ensure that lockdown restrictions are implemented in his jurisdiction.
Khadka says, “I spent the New Year Day focusing on how to make this lockdown more effective. This year, my wish for my family, friends, relatives and well-wishers also centred on COVID-19 safety, urging everyone to stay at home without panicking.”
Despite being an emergency service provider, Dr Srijana Thapa at National Institute of Neurological and Allied Sciences, however, got some time to rest this New Year. Monday was her weekly off. “Earlier, I used to be working in the hospital, serving patients. But this time, I was fortunate enough to have spent this day with my family watching a movie.” Thapa wishes that she could have gone somewhere with the family to celebrate the festival more lively if there had not been lockdown.
Amit Nakarmi, a university student from Bhaktapur, also thinks the same. He says, “As a Newar, different jatras have always been a vital part of our tradition and lifestyle. I along with my family used to participate and observe the Biska Jatra on the New Year’s Day every year. We used to worship the chariot, offer rice and rotis, and pull the chariot. But the celebration got cancelled this time. So, I spent the whole day inside the house with my family and my phone.”
Rajaram Basnet, a child rights activist from Dolakha, used to go to clubs on New Year’s Eve and party with his friends every year to celebrate the New Year. “But this year, I could not meet any friends,” he says, “Instead, I spent my time giving food to the dogs and birds on the street in front of my house in Kathmandu.”
Prapti Thapa, a lecturer at Orient College, tells a similar story. “Every year, on the New Year, we used to visit temples early in the morning, buy something new for all the family members and go out to a fine restaurant for lunch with all the family members. This year, due to the lockdown, we could do none of them.” As an option of celebrating the festival indoors, the Thapa family meditated together and prayed for the well-being of humankind, she informs. “We all tried to do something creative like painting, writing poems and gardening also to keep ourselves engaged and not to feel bored this New Year. We also played indoor games and entertained ourselves.”
In the evening on New Year’s Day, Thapa heard that three persons of a family in Kathmandu got infected with the virus, which left her sad for many minutes. She says, “We did not want to hear any more negative news about the COVID-19, particularly on the New Year’s Day.”
Children’s troubles
Not only adults, but children have also felt such changes in the New Year celebration pattern. Prarambha Budhathoki, a seventh-grader in Kathmandu, says, “This New Year was boring. It was not fun as it used to be as we could not go out for the celebrations. We could meet neither relatives nor friends. I was feeling as if I was in jail. I did not feel like enjoying.”
Likewise, nine-year-old Raj Giri from Sindhupalchok has his own story to share. He remembers visiting temples with his parents and older siblings in the mornings and going for family trips and dry picnic in different places every New Year in the past. But, this year, he is unhappy that he along with his family “stayed at home all day and spent this day as other regular days.”
Bliss for some
Though many people felt gloomy for being deprived of celebrations, there are a few who find this New Year experience blissful.
Earlier, on the New Year’s Eve and the New Year, there used to be grand celebrations at all hotels, clubs, restaurants and pubs. All picnic spots, cinema halls, temples and museums would also look crowded. Someone would rarely stay at home during this time. But, the scenario was totally different this year. All the hospitality businesses are shut due to one and obvious reason: the fear of coronavirus spread.
Consequently, Bindu Tamang, a waitress working at a restaurant in Thamel, says she got to celebrate this day enjoying with the family in her hometown of Nuwakot. She shares, “During this time in previous years, we had to work overtime and getting leave for the celebration was something totally unimaginable as restaurants would be packed with customers. However, this year I got a break due to the lockdown and I am happy that I celebrated this day with my whole family in peace.”
DJ Bipin Nakarmi shares Tamang’s feelings. “For the first time in the past 10 years, I was at home on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. My phone would ring nonstop as many things would go wrong during the event. But, this year, I was home watching movies and I liked it.”
He admits that he did miss the energy of New Year and all his crazy friends, appreciating this change at the same time. He says, “Even though it was a huge loss financially, I still don’t have many complaints.”"

A couple of years ago, in early 2018, I heard a calling from within. The message was simple: Whatever I was doing was not enough; I needed to do much more.
I was into a public sector job for the past four years and I believed that making a jump to something with social impact could help me bring about better tangible economic outcomes.
Now, my social impact initiatives are focused on poverty reduction, gender equity, women’s safety, and the environment. I am trying to protect and empower the very group of people that the government left behind, even during the Covid-19 crisis.
In 2014, I left the lure of the private sector to work for a newly instituted government agency. In the private sector, I was only helping a handful of shareholders make more money. In the government agency, I thought I could work towards making the lives of countless Nepalis better. Working for the government created an adrenalin rush. Countless community engagement plans, long and hard discussions with lawmakers, conflicts between the developer and the local community; each day brought a different set of challenges.
But, by 2018, the adrenalin rush had ebbed. Leadership changed; projects were stalled. Day by day, I found myself less effective. It was when I considered being a social entrepreneur and help people improve their lives. Two months after I left the government agency, I embarked on a mission: to make Kathmandu a safe, clean, and sustainable place.
My ventures have worked with Kathmandu and Lalitpur metropolitan city governments to create a renewable-powered and anti-traffic congestion system. The main spirit of these ventures was people; so I hired people from vulnerable households and communities.
But now, my projects have come to a complete stop due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Consequently, my employees have found it extremely difficult to make ends meet. Being a startup, I was unable to give them the required financial support. That is when I turned to the government for any possible help. I am still yet to hear back from them.
It is not rocket science to understand what is needed for startups/social initiatives up and running again, but it is rocket science to guess what the government has been thinking with respect to this. The government has not brought any financial measure for them so far. It does not have a plan on how to reopen the economy post-lockdown and whether the lockdown is really required. This is when startups like mine are throttled.
In this light, I recommend the government should give cash handouts and work on a strategy that leads to a reopening of the economy. We have plenty of options in the fiscal system for these handouts. With proper targeting, my employees will not feel the brunt of the Covid-19 crisis and can focus on work. Other social initiatives will operate in the same way.
Similarly, a ‘staggered’ reopening of the economy will allow daily wage earners to get back to work as soon as possible. My plea to the Nepal government is to help me help themselves.

The Kathmandu metropolitan city has failed to implement its decision to decentralise a vegetable market in Kalimati by making the traders sell the vegetables from different crossroads of the city.
In its bid to avoid any crowd in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the city government had made a decision to temporarily establish small-scale vegetable shops in different locations last week.
However, the shopkeepers returned to Kalimati again as the newly selected places lack basic facilities such as toilet and drinking water, according to a trader Gita Acharya.
Following the traders’ return, the Kalimati fruit and vegetable market has come into operation from today again. This market sells fruits and vegetables to most retailers and vendors of the city."

The government on Tuesday decided to extend the ongoing lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country till April 27.
A meeting of the Cabinet held this afternoon made the decision. Earlier, the lockdown was extended till Wednesday.
The country is on lockdown since March 24.
This decision was expected as Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had already hinted at the extension during his video conference with the chief ministers this Saturday. On the other hand, the number of coronavirus positive cases is steadily on the rise in the country.
Flights suspended till April 30
A minister says the meeting today also decided to suspend all flights till April 30. Earlier, the suspension on international flights was extended till that date, but the suspension on national flights was about to end tomorrow.
Border points with India unlikely to open even after end of lockdown
Meanwhile, the meeting decided to mobilise additional security personnel at Nepal-India border points as the number of cases is increasing in India. Just on Monday, a youth who had illegally crossed the border to enter Nepal during the lockdown had been confirmed infected with the virus.
A minister says the government has decided not to open the border points unless India returns to normalcy."

Kathmandu, April 14
The International Monetary Organisation on Monday has announced that it will provide immediate debt relief to Nepal and 24 other countries in order to help them combat the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
In a statement, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva says, “This provides grants to our poorest and most vulnerable members to cover their IMF debt obligations for an initial phase over the next six months and will help them channel more of their scarce financial resources towards vital emergency medical and other relief efforts.”
Under its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT), the IMF can currently provide about US$500 million in grant-based debt service relief, including the recent US$185 million pledge by the UK and US$100 million provided by Japan as immediately available resources.
Likewise, China and the Netherlands among others are also stepping forward with important contributions, the statement informs."

The government is testing everyone living on apartments of the Sun City Apartments in Kageshwari Manohara of Kathmandu after two residents there were found to be coronavirus positive.
Around 400 families are living on the apartments there.
The Ministry of Health and Population says the tests have already started. Likewise, the government is also tracing other persons who came into contact with the infected ones since they came to Kathmandu from London around one month ago.
Whereas two persons of the same family tested positive for the virus, another member of the family did not test positive in the polymerase chain reaction test. The third member had also tested positive in the rapid diagnostic test.
Meanwhile, after confirming that they travelled to Kathmandu on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha on March 18, police have also begun tracing other passengers of the flight. An official in the Nepal Police Headquarters says the police will quarantine all 153 of them once they are identified.

The Office of the Auditor General says it has failed to submit its annual report of the fiscal year 2018/19 to the president on time due to the lockdown restrictions.
This is the first time in the past 10 years that the office has been unable to complete its report on time. The office normally submits its report to the head of the state by the end of the first nine months of the next fiscal year. As per the schedule, it was supposed to submit the report before Sunday.
Deputy Auditor General Bishnu Prasad Rijal says the audit of all transactions was over and the staff were writing the report when the government imposed the lockdown making it impossible to compile different reports.
Stakeholders have expressed concerns that the delay in submitting the report would affect the government bodies’ commitment to transparency.

Nepal’s health officials have reported two more coronavirus positive cases in the country’s capital on Tuesday. With this, the number of positive cases in the country has reached 16.
Earlier on Monday, three persons of the family residing at Sun City Apartments in Kageshwari Manohara of the capital had tested positive in the rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Because the RDT results are not considered valid globally, the authorities had collected their swab samples for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.
While the two of them tested positive in the PCR tests also.
The family of a woman, her son, and daughter-in-law had come to Kathmandu from the United Kingdom around one month ago. Of them, the 81-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son tested positive for the virus.
They are being treated at Patan Hospital of Kathmandu."

The Nepal Tourism Board has begun a survey to assess the impact of Covid-19 crisis on the country’s tourism and other related sectors.
The board’s Chief Executive Officer Dhananjaya Regmi says the survey will be conducted at an extensive scale, aiming at finding out exact data about the impact of the crisis on the sector.
Currently, the board does not have any idea about how many companies are operational in the country’s tourism sector. It has barred the authorities from estimating the crisis’ impact on the sector.
The board informs that the survey will cover eight sectors in particular, namely: airlines, hotels, tourist vehicles, restaurants, rafting companies, trekking and mountaineering, travel and tourism and other activities related to tourism.
After analysing the data, the board will forward its report to the government recommending measures to recover. A few weeks back, the entrepreneurs had expressed their dissatisfaction over initial measures the government had announced for them.
Meanwhile, tourism entrepreneurs have estimated that the sector would lose Rs 40 billion to the crisis. The Hotel Association Nepal has warned that 1.1 million workers are at the risk of losing their jobs."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

The National Association of Rural Municipalities in Nepal, an association of leaders of all rural municipalities across the country, has urged concerned local governments to provide food and other basics to the people who are leaving Kathmandu defying the lockdown.
The association issued the request as the media reported that scores of people were leaving the capital on foot after they lost their job, and subsequently income, to the lockdown restrictions.
The association has categorically requested rural municipalities of Kavre, Sindhuli, Sindhupalchok, Dhading, Nuwakot and Makawanpur districts to provide food and water to them. Whenever possible, the local governments have been urged to collect detailed information about them and forward it to the local governments of the places where the people are heading to."

After discovering four coronavirus positive cases in the past two days, the Province 2 government has identified 12 hotspots of coronavirus infection, deciding to take maximum precautions in these areas.
Earlier on Sunday, three Indian nationals who were moving in different places of the province for the past two months and currently living in Birgunj were confirmed of the infection. The next day, a teenage boy who had crossed the Nepal-India border to arrive in a town in Rautahat district tested positive for the virus.
Hence, most hotspots identified by the government are close to the border. Besides the area of Birgunj where the three coronavirus positive cases were found, the place in Saptari where a Muslim function was held two months ago has also been identified as a hotspot.
“We will conduct security checks and monitoring in those places,” the provincial government spokesperson, Internal Affairs and Law Minister Gyanendra Yadav, says, “It the areas need to be sealed off, we will do that too.”
Concerned officials and security and health workers monitored the places on Monday also, according to him."

Two young men from Kathmandu Valley were seen on the country’s eastern frontier, Kakarbhitta, inside the car (Ba 6 Cha 7019) on Sunday last week. Dil Kumar Shrestha, 33, of Lalitpur and Ganesh Adhikari, 28, of Kathmandu introduced themselves as medical persons and stated that they had come to Kakarbhitta for a health camp.
But, officials of the local police post say the duo did not look like health workers. Further, their identity cards were blurred.
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Rajendra Pokharel says, “As soon as we started inquiring about the health camp in detail, they seemed inconsistent. We had to call another doctor in order to find out the reality.”
The local doctor came to support the police investigation and asked the suspects their registration numbers with the Nepal Medical Council. They were answerless.
Only then, the two admitted their mistake.
Officers involved in the investigation say, “Finally, during the interrogation process, it was revealed that both men were not medical persons, but drug abusers.” They had also confiscated Rs 125,000 cash from them.
As they did not find drugs in the valley, they seem to have gone there seeking the substances. The police have now quarantined them in Mechinagar.
According to Basanta Lama, the acting chief of the Narcotics Control Bureau, addicted drug users are ready to go anywhere to get their drugs. “So despite the lockdown, the drug addicts are running here and there,” SSP Lama tells Onlinekhabar, “But with the lockdown practised even in the neighbouring country (India), the supply of drugs is almost impossible at present.”
“Meanwhile, the bureau is also aware that previously-stocked materials may be traded,” Lama says.
How lockdown served as an opportunity for murder

Due to the lockdown, Urmila Devi Pandit’s family was in the house at Ramnagari, Bahudarmai municipality-8, Parsa. She would have rarely thought that she would breathe her last on April 3 night.
However, as the neighbours were also locked in their houses, her father-in-law Suresh Pandit, mother-in-law Phul Kumari Devi and sister-in-law Malwi Devi murdered 27-year-old Urmila, reveals Ganga Pant, the chief of Parsa District Police Office.
According to police, the family tried to destroy the evidence by burning her body the next day, seizing the chance of the lockdown. However, the police surrounded the ghat and took control on time, before the body was burnt.
Initially, the family claimed that Urmila Devi committed suicide, but in that case also, it was against the law to burn the body without informing the police.
“During the investigation, it is found that they killed her suspecting that she was having an extra-marital affair while her husband was abroad,” SP Pant tells Onlinekhabar, adding, “Further investigation is underway.”
 ‘Big fish’ got arrested
On Tuesday last week, the police arrested businessperson Sulav Agarwal from Naxal on the charge of black-marketeering.
An owner of the Shanker Group, Agarwal was accused of selling infrared thermometers, which cost around Rs 3,000-5,000 per unit, at Rs 15,000 each.
SSP Sahakul Bahadur Thapa of the Metropolitan Police Crime Division says Agarwal, also the honorary consul of Kyrgyzstan in Nepal, was arrested during a covert operation carried on the basis of a tip-off. Thirty-eight thermal guns were confiscated from him.
Meanwhile, he is also found to have misused a vehicle of a diplomatic agency having blue number plate. Police also confiscated the vehicle.
Theft and violence against women

Theft cases have also been reported in the valley during the lockdown. A few days ago, within a couple of hundred metres away from Basundhara Chok, an unidentified gang barged into a house and stole Rs 100,000 in cash.
According to DSP Hobindra Bogati, there was no one in the house during the theft.
According to DSP Rungam Kunwar, chief of the Metropolitan Police Circle in Kalimati, a theft case has been reported in his area also during the lockdown, whose investigation is in progress.
Meanwhile, many verbal complaints have been registered in the Women and Children Cell in Kalimati during this period. As the lockdown got extended, cases of domestic violence may increase, says one official there.
“But the lockdown has made it difficult for many to file a complaint,” she adds, hence the number of written complaints is comparatively low.
“Violence happening in educated families comes out, but most of the problems are in the uneducated class,” she adds, “The class which is in a state of great suffering does not want to come to the police.”
The chief of Kathmandu Metropolitan Police Range, Uttam Raj Subedi suggests, telephoning the police control helpline number 100 or contacting the nearest police station in such cases, assuring the police would go to the victim’s doorsteps whenever needed.
Cybercrime on the rise

According to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner’s Office, Ranipokhari, so many cybercrime complaints have been registered in the valley during the lockdown. Just in Kathmandu district, three incidents of electronic crime have been registered.
Nabendra Aryal, an official of the Central Cybercrime Bureau, says 37 complaints have been received in the bureau in this period. According to him, most of the applications are on issues like social media profile blocking and fake IDs.
“During the lockdown, as most people are at home only, busy on their computers and the internet, the crime has increased,” SSP Aryal tells Onlinekhabar.
He adds, “We also have sent letters to the Facebook office to assist in many cases in the investigation. However, the answer has not come yet. “ Nevertheless, Aryal assures that required and best possible analysis and investigation of the incidents are going on.
According to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bishwa Raj Pokharel, there have been 78 cases registered in various charges throughout the valley from the beginning of lockdown till April 6. Before that, nearly 300 criminal cases used to be registered in just one week.
In the lockdown period, the highest number of cases registered is of accidental deaths (40). Although there has been only one theft case registered, more than 10 such incidents have been made public. Three rape cases and a few drug-related cases have been registered in this period.
SSP Umesh Raj Joshi, the central spokesperson of Nepal Police, however, claims the rate of crime is negligible during this period as the movement of people across the country has slowed down.
International trends in the pandemic and Nepal’s challenges

International media have also reported similar trends across the world. The number of arrests has decreased during the lockdown; however, the number of theft and other property crimes has increased in many places.
Some American media have reported that medical material such as surgical mask has been stolen from clinics. The news of assaulting Chinese citizens in the US has also come out. The number of frauds has increased in different countries.
In some countries, the general public has been found to be abusive to feverish persons. Likewise, other types of abuses including coughing at the side of a person one dislikes or envies or with whom one is angry have been reported.
Retired Nepal Police AIG Devendra Subedi says as the lockdown continues, its byproducts are becoming more visible in the society and it is not surprising at all.
“This is a new experience for everyone. But, as the lockdown goes on, it can lead to a point where a citizen has to choose between hunger and disease,” Subedi tells Onlinekhabar, “Then criminal activities will increase.” However, he says Nepal is not in a dire state now.
According to sociologist Kailash Nath Pyakurel, with the extension of the lockdown, people might suffer from anger, frustration, depression and anxiety. As a result of that, different types of crime will happen.
He adds, “Middle-class families and labourers are making a living by doing small businesses.  They have no alternative to livelihoods during long days of the shutdown which can lead society in the wrong direction.” Hence, it is crucial for all the units of the society along with the government to be aware of this issue, he suggests.
“As of now, the working class is getting support from the local government or other organisations. However, as the situation gets worse, scarier situations, when one fears helping them as well, could come,” says Hemant Malla Thakuri, a retired DIG of Nepal Police, adding, “If such a situation comes, the working class who are starving may become the biggest threat.”"

The government has released a list of 11 hospitals across the country which shall provide treatment to the patients confirmed of coronavirus infection or those suspected of it.
The list includes both government-run and private facilities. The government has categorised them into different groups assigning different responsibilities. There are 25 hub hospitals and 64 provincial hospitals.
The Ministry of  Health and Population released an interim directive on the management of Covid-19 treatment specifying rights, roles, and responsibilities of these hospitals today.
With this directive, the government has expected to make private hospitals responsible for Covid-19 cases as media of late reported that they were not handling the cases fearing infection to the health workers themselves.
The health facilities have also been told to continue other regular health services also, smoothly."

Another person is confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus on Monday afternoon. With this, the number of coronavirus infected persons in Nepal has reached 14.
A 19-year-old boy in Rautahat district of southern Nepal tested positive for the virus, according to health officials. He was quarantined for the past few days.
It has been found that he had returned his home in Ishnath municipality of the district on March 29, the sixth day of nationwide lockdown. After he reached home, the family refused to let him stay in the house and sent him to the quarantine camp set up by the municipality, according to the municipality’s information officer Krishna Nandan Kumar.
Four others, who were with him in the quarantine, however, tested negative.
Earlier today, a 65-year-old woman from Lamki Chuha of Kailali had also tested positive for the virus.
So far, nearly 11,000 persons have been tested for the virus, according to the Ministry of Health. The ministry’s spokesperson Bikas Devkota says 5,691 persons have undergone the PCR tests whereas 5,291 persons have done rapid diagnostic tests.
Across the country, 103 persons are in isolation as they have been suspected of infection."

Birgunj, April 13
Fifty-nine persons who were in contact with three Indians who have been confirmed of coronavirus infection have tested negative for the virus.
Parsa’s Assistant Chief District Officer Lalit Kumar Basnet says those tested negative in the rapid diagnostic test for the virus. He says other persons who have been suspected of the infection will undergo the test today also.
Meanwhile, Narayani Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Madan Upadhyaya says swab samples have been collected from additional nine persons and they will be sent for PCR tests.
With the confirmation of the infection on Sunday, authorities have adopted higher precaution measures in the district. The vicinity of the mosque where the infected persons were living has been sealed. Nepal Police and Armed Police Force have been mobilised to stop anyone from moving in.
None but pharmacies are open."

Kathmandu metropolitan city’s mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya has assured that the city government will help people who have been deprived of food and other basics due to the ongoing lockdown.
Shakya says they are not needed to leave the city defying the lockdown as the local government will look after them.
As dozens of people have begun to leave the city after they lost the job and income due to the lockdown, Shakya says in his message to the public on the occasion of New Year 2077, “We have been providing relief materials to those in problem through our ward offices.”
“Please contact your concerned ward office or the toll-free number 1180 if you faced any problem. But, please do not leave the city in this time of crisis.”"

Province 2 Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut has assured that Birgunj, a major city of the province, will start the coronavirus test service from Tuesday.
Raut’s statement comes one day after three coronavirus positive cases have confirmed in the city. Meanwhile, local stakeholders have accused Raut’s government of non-cooperation in establishing a coronavirus-dedicated hospital there.
But, Raut says another coronavirus test lab will be established in Rajbiraj of Saptari district also within this week. A few days ago, the provincial government had decided to install testing equipment in Janakpurdham, Rajbiraj, and Birgunj. The lab in Janakpurdham has already come into operation.
Meanwhile, in his greetings to the public on the occasion of New Year 2077 on Monday, Raut wished that the number of coronavirus positive cases would not increase above three now."

A leading airline company of the country, Himalayan Airlines, on Sunday donated Rs 10 million to the government fund established to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
The Nepal-China joint venture company’s vice-president Vijay Shrestha handed over a cheque worth that amount to the Minister for Civil Aviation, Yogesh Bhattarai, the company informs. Tourism and Civil Aviation Secretary Kedar Bahadur Adhikari among other officials were present on the occasion.
“Himalaya Airlines and its family stand firmly by the government and the people of Nepal during this critical time,” the company’s president, Zhou Enyong, in his message to the government. “This is the time for all of us to unite in the national health emergency and contribute our part towards successfully ending this battle.”"

Nepal has confirmed its 13th coronavirus positive case on Monday.
A 65-year-old woman in Kailali district of Sudurpaschim tested positive for the virus, according to health officials.
The woman was quarantined at Lamki Multiple Campus in Lamki Chuha of the district for the past two weeks.
The woman had a teashop in Birgunj, where three coronavirus positive cases were confirmed recently, and she had gone to Kailali three weeks ago to meet a relative, it has been learned.
A few days back, she had undergone a rapid diagnostic test for the virus, but the result had come negative. Following that, she was sent home from the quarantine site.
However, the officials had sent her swab samples for a PCR test that showed a positive result. With the new result, authorities are preparing to bring all the persons who were sent home from quarantine sites back."
"
After the confirmation of three coronavirus positive cases in the city, stakeholders in Birgunj demanded that the authorities establish a special hospital dedicated to the coronavirus infection. However, their hope is unlikely to materialise anytime soon.
Earlier, the Province 2 government had announced to establish coronavirus-dedicated hospitals in Kalaiya of Bara and Jaleshwar of Mahottari. Now, the stakeholders in the city demand that the next one is established in Birgunj.
Birgunj mayor Bijaya Sarawagi complains that provincial and federal governments have not heeded his demand for the hospital. The metropolitan city’s advisor Govinda Devkota says discussions were held repeatedly about establishing the hospital by renting the space of Birgunj Health Care Hospital, but no conclusion was achieved. He also blames the provincial government for the failure.
The provincial government is not interested to open rent a private facility’s space even though there are not sufficient government facilities that could be developed as coronavirus-dedicated hospitals, it has been learned."

Nepal is celebrating the New Year on Monday as the Bikram Sambat 2077 begins. Customarily, various government officials and political leaders have issued their greetings statements on the occasion.
As the entire world is fighting against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and its impact on various dimensions of life, the leaders in their messages have wished that the country would be able to control the outbreak and return to normalcy as soon as possible.
President Bidya Devi Bhandari wished that the New Year would give the citizens energy to prevent the infection and subsequent crisis. Likewise, Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun hoped that the global crisis would end at the beginning of the year.
Stating that the county was welcoming the New Year in a difficult situation, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also announced to contribute his salary to the country’s Covid-19 response.
Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota, the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and former king Gyanendra Shah among others have issued their statements on the occasion."
"
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli says he will not receive his salary as long as the impact of Covid-19 pandemic continues in the country.
In his message to the nation on the occasion of  New Year 2077 BS on Monday morning, Oli says his salary would be deposited in the government fund established to control the outbreak in the country till then. According to him, the Nepali society has a culture of giving up one’s possessions for the sake of the needy, and his move follows that.
The prime minister says all people should be united in distributing achievements of the country’s progress fairly, and it is also their duty to bear the cost of loss together as this global crisis can be overcome only with partnership and cooperation.
Oli also thanked other countries also for their support in Nepal’s fights against the coronavirus crisis."

The reason for all is one and nothing surprising; the spread of novel coronavirus has compelled people to be inside and avoid any kind of social gatherings. The streets of Kathmandu Valley that would have been hustling and bustling with revellers and devotees have been silent this year. The New Year has begun in silence this year.
Compensatory rituals
Festivals and rituals have their own meanings and are to be performed as per the age-old traditions. When something does not go according to the traditions, the incumbent priests perform a special kind of puja, locally known as kshama puja (a ritual to ask for forgiveness). As the majority of festivals of this time of the year have been cancelled, all the local priests and leaders from local guthis have already performed kshama pujas. The puja is performed mostly on the day of the said festival.

The first festival whose celebration was ‘cancelled’ was Paachahre for which the local priests of Ason, Kankeshwori, and other Ajimas have already performed puja for not being able to conduct the pujas as before.
After the popular Seto Machhindra Jatra was cancelled, the priests of the temple also performed the puja on April 1. For Handigaun Jatra, Kathmandu metropolitan city’s ward 5’s chairperson Ramesh Dangol informs the locals have performed three separate kshama pujas for Naxal Bhagwati, Tundal Devi, and Bhatbhateni on April 7, 9 and 11 respectively on the day they were supposed to be taken out of the respective temples.
Likewise, many clusters of local priests and guthiyars have already conducted kshama pujas in different temples of Bhaktapur district including Bishnu Bir and Balkumari, major attractions among the 19 processions taken out this time of the year from Thimi.
Priests of Rato Machhindranath have already performed the snan (bathing) of the idol on Thursday. The kshama pujas for the festival and for the rath construction, which have to be performed by two different groups, have not been scheduled yet. They will be held after the lockdown is over.
Yagya Ratna Shakya, the chair of the 32-Paneju Sangha, a group of local priests, in Bungamati of Lalitpur, here stresses, “It is important to keep the rituals going. Completely dropping the rituals might lead us to a point where people might think that it is okay not to follow the rituals, do them as their conveniences or completely stop realising its importance, threatening the continuity of our rich and important cultures and traditions. For this, the government also needs to give priority to the cultures even during this time of crisis. Whatever that needs to be done, even if it is in a smaller scale, should be continued.”
A few controversies
While other festivals have been cancelled as they are conducted as per the auspicious time, in specific time of the year, the longest festival in Kathmandu–Rato Machhindranath Jatra– has been postponed. The idol spends about six months a year in Bungamati while for the other six, the idol is placed and worshipped in Ta:Baha: of Patan. “So far, the festival and rath construction have been postponed. The idol has to be installed in Bungamati before Dashain. So if the lockdown is lifted on time, the construction of rath and the festival will resume,” informs Shakya.
Meanwhile, the nine-day celebration of Biska Jatra in Bhaktapur has landed in a controversy. The festival itself and the gathering of the people for processions have been cancelled publicly, adhering to the government’s directive. However, locals as well as the guthiyars have complaints that the decision was made solely by the mayor without consulting them.
A local, on the condition of anonymity, shares, “Everyone is unhappy about the decision. However, those who should be speaking up are keeping quiet. There is a debate over what to do next. The procession and gathering being cancelled is understandable, but there are rituals to perform inside the temples, for which they have not given clear instructions as to what rituals to perform, to what extent and what to avoid this year. Everyone is looking at the priests of Balkumari Temple. However, they are themselves in a huge dilemma given the lack of clear instructions.”
Persistent risks
Though the festivals have been called off, the traditions are followed inside the temple premises. Every morning, people visit their local temples though the number is low. Kathmandu metropolitan city’s ward 5’s chairperson Dangol says those who are more religiously inclined, mostly women, are still insisting on visiting the temples. “About 10 per cent of the population here (in Handigaun) still visits the temple.”
The point of social distancing and the ongoing lockdown is to cut off any human contact and spread of the virus from symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. But people thronging the temples pose the risk of spread and here, the priests become more exposed and more vulnerable to contracting the virus.
One of the temples people still throng is Seto Machhindranath in Keltole, Kathmandu. The main priest of the temple, Saroj Muni Bajracharya, says, “It is a norm that no one has to touch the main priest so I do not come in contact directly. But some people are still visiting in the mornings as the entrance to the bahal (courtyard) is open for the devotees to enter. However, others working in and around the temple are more vulnerable, which is why, after the daily rituals, we shut the metal bar that surrounds the temple to maintain distance.”
As another measure to avoid contracting the virus, people are suggested to wear masks, and gloves. However, the practice is not common among the priests. “The use of gloves or masks is not against traditions. Some including the priests are using it while working in the temple. However, there is a population that ridicules their use while performing religious activities,” says Shakya of Bungamati.
Adding, Shakya says that there are still people who think that the coronavirus will not touch them because of their faith in their god. Moreover, such people are also not seen following any preventive measures to keep themselves or others safe.
On another side of the valley, a local of Madhyapur Thimi complains that people can still be seen out of their houses, chatting and roaming as before. There is zero social distancing; the lockdown has not made any impact on them, he stresses.
Bigger fears
The cancellation of these many festivals in the same year was unheard of before. This poses a question if the discontinuity of the festivals will result in any kind of mishaps as believed by many. While priests of the respective temples have assured that there is not any concrete proof or written account of that happening, there still is a doubt in the back of their minds.
Shakya says, “Some 1450 years ago, when Nepal (the word for Kathmandu Valley then) was going through a drought which lasted for 12 years, Rato Machhindra, who is considered the god of rain and harvest, was installed and the suffering came to an end. However, now, the festival has been postponed; we are not sure what the future holds for us. We certainly do not want to go back to the same fate or see a bigger plague and drought amid this situation where everyone is already living in fear of the pandemic.”
But, culture researcher Purna Ratna Bajracharya expresses that though the social and cultural impacts of the postponement and cancellation of the festivals cannot be avoided, a better and more responsible approach is to avoid the rituals altogether."

Two container trucks have been stopped just a few metres away from the police check post at Nagdhunga Pass, the western gateway to Kathmandu Valley. Around those trucks are small crowds of people. It looks there is a fair underway. But how can one host any fair when the entire country is locked down to control the coronavirus outbreak?
Most of the people, it seems, are construction labourers.
The workers later tell you they have nothing to eat and are penniless as they lost their jobs to the lockdown, which is why they want to return to their homes. Some say they have to reach to Nepalgunj, some to Birgunj, some other to Rautahat and Sarlahi. They were standing there carrying bags on their hands.
It is Friday (April 10) night, the 18th day of the nationwide lockdown.
—

The workers are pleading with the truck drivers to take them home. But, the drivers have their own hardship.
“Police make us stop the truck and hit us with their batons. They shout at us and force us to leave the travellers,” speaks one of the truck drivers.
“Then, where else can we go except our homes as we have nothing to eat in Kathmandu?” a labourer assures, “We will request the police officials. We will not let any trouble come to you.”
Interrupting them, the truck driver again speaks, “Try to understand. We will be in trouble. We have to travel this route regularly and the police might bother us time and again.”
While the driver is speaking, another worker says, “What kind of government we have? It neither can feed us in Kathmandu nor allows us to go to out.”
—

A young man from Bardiya of the same crowd shares his story:
It had been only 10 days that the four of us had arrived in Kathmandu and only five days that we had started to work. We used to stay at the construction site. 
Then, the lockdown started. The contractor was Indian; he returned to his house before the lockdown was imposed. And here, we are suffering all alone. We came here to earn money, so we had not brought any money from home. For some days, we managed some food for ourselves asking for money from the close ones. But, it has already run out. We waited this long for the end of the lockdown, but now it seems we will die starving. That is why we have embarked on our journey to our own places from Lokanthali (of Bhaktapur).
From Lokanthali until here, many police personnel interrogated us. We shared our problems with them. Some of them let us continue our journey offering some water to drink whereas some others hit us with their batons saying we violated the rules. But, we did not have any other alternative than this.
—

The workers came here in the capital with big expectations of earning money and enhancing their quality of life. Instead of meeting their hopes, they are suffering today.
The sufferings and stories of most of the labourers stranded at Nagadhunga are similar. Everyone wants to leave Kathmandu and returns to their homes. Their bags are filled with fried lentils and beaten rice. They are firm to reach their homes even by walking.
After witnessing all these sufferings and hearing their misery, it feels like Kathmandu and the central government are totally indifferent to and inconsiderate about these labourers and their sufferings. Amidst this uncertainty, instead of encouraging them to stay in Kathmandu managing them some daily essentials like food, they are charging batons on them.
As the workers and the truck drivers continue their talk, another truck arrives there. After a brief conversation, half of the workers get into it.
The other half is still stranded. Meanwhile, a driver assures that he would help them go up to Narayangadh; but he has a precondition for the passengers, “You have to take responsibility for the police on the way.”
—

In just a few minutes, more than a hundred people crossed Nagdhunga on two trucks. They were saying like, “We will face whatever comes. If we get some vehicle, we will go on it. Else we will walk on foot.”

Bhaktapur, April 12
The test for coronavirus has begun in Bhaktapur Hospital after the hospital received the kit for rapid diagnostic tests.
Those foreign returnees and suspected to have contracted the deadly virus will be tested at the hospital from today, informs the hospital’s superintendent, Dr Sumitra Gautam.
The 300 test kits were sent to the hospital by the provincial Ministry of Health.
Anyone tested positive for the virus will be treated in isolation in the hospital, but in case of further treatment and test, the infected ones will be sent to Teku-based Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. Currently, the hospital has a 10-bed isolation ward.
The hospital so far has collected nasal and throat swabs of 154 suspected ones and sent to the National Public Health Laboratory, among which 90 were tested negative while results are awaited for the rest 64.
Around 25 to 50 people infected with flu and fever have been visiting the hospital on a daily basis, the hospital says. The hospital has been providing regular healthcare services during the lockdown on the contrary to many private health facilities that have ceased rendering OPD and other healthcare services during this period.

Alarmed by the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis in South Asia among other regions of the world, the World Bank has forecast a sharp fall in the growth rate of the gross domestic product in Nepal.
A report launched by the bank on Sunday forecasts 1.5 to 2.8 per cent growth in the country’s economy next fiscal year. The bank forecasts that the crisis may subdue the country’s economy in the next two years also, and the country’s GDP growth rate might be restricted to 1.4 to 2.9 and 2.4 to 3.6 per cent respectively.
The bank has estimated 7.1 per cent growth for this year.
The bank says lower remittances, trade and tourism, and broader disruptions caused by the outbreak will trigger low economic growth in Nepal.
“We are closely monitoring how the Covid-19 pandemic is evolving across Nepal,” states Faris Hadad-Zervos, World Bank Country Manager for Nepal. “Our immediate priority is to coordinate our action with the government, private sector and international development partners to ensure that health supplies and equipment are readily available and that a comprehensive recovery package is in place to support the poor and most vulnerable.”"

Following the confirmation of three new coronavirus infection cases in Birgunj city, Parsa district of Province 2, the provincial government has hinted at the implementation of stricter measures in the city.
Whereas the nationwide lockdown is still on, Province 2 Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut says his government will impose a ‘complete lockdown’ in the city. Talks are underway with the federal government’s Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa for this, according to him.
“We have been discussing additional measures needed to be introduced in this situation,” Raut tells Onlinekhabar, adding the border security is tight now and the locals are aware of restricting people’s movement. “Whenever they see anyone new in the village, they send them to quarantine sites. Local people’s representatives and security personnel are also supporting.”
He, however, lamented the slow pace of coronavirus tests."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Along with launching the Ultrabooks with Xiaomi branding, the company also has released new laptops that are much more affordable compared to the Ultrabooks. The two laptops–Redmi Book 15 and 15 Pro–share similar build and specifications. Both of them feature an 11th gen processor and provide HD display and durable battery life.
Let’s get into the details of Redmi Book 15 and Book 15 Pro.
Specifications
Redmi Book 15 and Book 15 Pro are virtually identical in terms of designs and only some specifications separate them from each other. The laptop has a metallic brush finish that gives the laptop a neat look. Redmi branding has been done on the outer lid of the laptop. 
Talking about the ports, both laptops feature 1 x USB 2.0, 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 1 x HDMI 1.4, 1 x RJ45 (LAN port) and 1 x 3.5mm audio jack.
The laptop has a thickness of 19.9mm and weighs around 1.8kg.
Redmi Book 15 and Book 15 Pro feature a 15.6-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1,920*1,080 pixels. It also features a 720p resolution HD webcam. With a 1.5mm deep key travel keyboard, the trackpad on the laptop is also wide and supports multi-touch gestures.

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Worldwide, millions of people stay at home to minimise transmissions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, but healthcare workers (HCWs) prepare to do the exact opposite.
The HCWs will go to clinics, hospitals, and other high-risk environments and are more prone of becoming the victim of Covid-19. We have heard and watched some horrific stories of thousands of HCWs already falling ill and dying at different parts of the world during the ongoing pandemic crisis. We need to understand and implement what hospitals can do to lower the rate of infection among HCWs as this pandemic accelerates.
The success of lower infection among the HCWs not just comes from the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), but also from the high level of exactitude with which hospital infection control measures are applied. There is an imperative need to safeguard our HCWs who are core for fighting the crisis.
The global healthcare system is already operating at more than maximum capacity for many months. But, the HCWs, unlike life-saving ventilators, cannot be urgently manufactured or run at full occupancy in the long run. Thus, it is important that governments and health departments place appropriate strategies to minimise infections among the HCWs.
The following key principles should be followed for that:
It is believed the effective measures and principles behind this can help minimise infections among the HCWs and we can combat the spread of the coronavirus.
Minimising the movement and restrict unwanted visitors

How does the virus move within a hospital?
There are different ports of entry of the virus within a hospital.  Categorically, they can be classified as low risk, moderate risk, and high risk.
Non-patient care areas, ambulatory care areas and medical wards with asymptomatic non-Covid-19 patients are classified as low-risk exposure to the virus.
Screening and triage clinics, the medical ward where clinically stable suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients who do not require high medical intervention such as intubation, scope or any other procedures that may aerosolise viral particles may constitute the moderate risks. The HCWs can assume exposure to the virus primarily via droplet particles but less likely by air.
The intensive care unit (ICU), high dependency unit (HDU), acute care unit (ACU), and procedure rooms for severely ill and confirmed Covid-19 patients are the high-risk areas. The HCWs can assume working in these areas are more susceptible to infection.
Below are the three key aspects of infection control the hospitals need to address in order to protect their HCWs:
How to place policies and processes in place to minimise infection risk within and between different departments of the hospitals?
LOW RISK
It is extremely important to screen at all entry and exit points of any hospital. The patients and staff who are asymptomatic and have no history of close contact with suspected or confirmed cases might enter the hospital and proceed to low-risk zones along dedicated routes that avoid travelling through moderate and high-risk zones. But, they also must be screened with questionnaires and body temperature monitoring.  The screening questions may include:
The suspected Covid-19 cases then should be directed away from low-risk zones into separate areas of the hospital. Clear signs and physical barriers help to reduce unnecessary traffic that may facilitate the spread of the virus.
It is important for health departments to differentiate the categories of surgeries.  Differentiating into four categories from urgent to non-urgent is very effective during a pandemic crisis:
Category 1:Procedures that are clinically indicated within 30 days
Category 2: Procedures that are clinically indicated within 90 days
Category 3: Procedures that are clinically indicated within 365 days
Category 4: Procedure that are clinically indicated after 365 days
Routine care should be conducted remotely through phone or video or at screening areas physically away from the hospital environment.
The risk of asymptomatic transmission should equally be considered seriously. Social distancing measures such as distance keeping, isolating areas, and installing droplet precaution around all the departments of hospitals should be effectively placed and monitored.
MODERATE RISK 
The HCWs are venerable and posses a greater risk of transmitting the virus to each other via fomites. The hospitals should minimise this risk by setting up clearly marked, designated, access-controlled exits. Buffer zones should be set up at exits in which the HCWs can carefully doff PPE so that potentially contaminated PPE does not enter low- risk zones.
Transporting infected patients from isolated areas possesses a risk of contaminating the environment and surrounding for the HCWs and other general public. Dedicated, clearly marked routes for transfers minimises the risk of contamination. Any person transferring a Covid-19 patient should be in the full PPE.
To conserve PPE and limit contamination from donning and doffing, the HCWs in moderate or high-risk areas should always remain in PPE during their entire shift. The shifts should be limited to four to six hours to limit fatigue. Telecommunication facilities should be installed in place to communicate with patients to avoid unnecessary exposure.
A confirmed Covid-19 case should be immediately separated from the general ward to a designated ward in order to minimise cross-contamination.
A designated infection control or a Covid-19 officer should oversee all the related cases. Their responsibility should also focus on monitoring and training for correct usage of PPE.
HIGH RISK 
A highly trained staff group is required to look after a complex patient. In order to maintain the flow of highly trained staff, the hospitals should implement up-skilling programmes with a proper education and training package.
Dedicated HCWs should be staffed accordingly. While on duty, they should be typically housed in hospital accommodation and should be discouraged from interacting with community or non-Covid-19 patients. They are required to have negative Covid-19 PCR before returning to non-Covid-19 duties. A rotating cycle of two weeks on and one week off should be implemented to assist their health and wellbeing.
Appropriate use of PPE in different exposure risk areas
The highest priority of the government and healthcare organisations is to provide access to masks and other PPE requirements for the frontline HCWs.
General principles:
The highest standards of PPE should be in place for the HCWs caring for Covid-19 patients. This is a highly transmissible disease so the PPE is required not only to protect the HCWs but also for our broader community. The PPEs should be applied based on the levels of exposure risk.
LOW RISK 
Not everybody walking around a hospital is required to wear PPE.  Masks are more effective when worn by potentially infected individuals to prevent the risk of transmission.
MODERATE RISK 
The risk of transmission from the Covid-19 patients who do not require aerosol-generating procedures is classified to be largely from droplets from patient coughing and from fomites.  The HCWs in a moderate risk zone should wear:
The hospitals are also advised to supply full head-to-toe protective gears including surgical caps/hoods and shoe covers.
HIGH RISK 
Extreme precautions should be in place in a high-risk zone. At this level, the presumed risk of transmission is airborne. The HCWs are required to cover their entire body to protect them from aerosol particles from contaminating any parts of the body.
Comprehensive screening and monitoring of the workforce

Healthcare workers are at higher infection risk than the general public. Regular screening of the HCWs should be done to prevent the spread both within and from hospitals. Regular screening also allows infections to be caught early, which can reduce the spread and improve clinical outcomes. The hospitals need to introduce the following policies for screening their workers:
The additional measures like the following will also help:

Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has hinted at the possibility of extending the nationwide lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Likewise, he says the country does not need any other body to deal with the crisis except the government.
In a video conference with chief ministers of all the provinces on Saturday, the prime minister said the government would not end the lockdown anytime soon as the number of infected cases was increasing in India at a steady rate. Otherwise, the lockdown was scheduled to end the coming Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Oli also requested chief ministers of the provinces that share borders with India to further tighten border security measures to protect the country from the outbreak.
During the meeting, Oli said the government was efficient enough to control the pandemic in the country, hence we would not favour any other mechanism. His statement apparently targets a demand for an all-party mechanism demanded by smaller parties.
“The government itself is an authority. Another mechanism is not required. No one should act as if they are issuing directives while staying at home whereas the government’s authority is working.”
During the meeting, the chief ministers informed the prime minister about initiatives they have taken about controlling the coronavirus outbreak, informs Oli’s press advisor Surya Thapa."

Many people believe music is a universal and timeless art. However, time apparently matters in music composition and consumption in any country. That is the reason why, the Nepali society is flooded with hundreds of new songs every September because Nepali women celebrate the annual Teej festival that month, and the festival is known for a particular kind of song that the merrymakers sing in celebrations.
September is still five months away but the Nepali music industry is flooded with a new plethora of songs now: the coronavirus songs. In different styles and structures, from rap to traditional dohori, there appears a long list of Nepali ‘coronavirus songs’ on YouTube.
‘Awareness drive’
One of the first Nepali coronavirus songs was sung by popular singer Pashupati Sharma. This song was out for the audience on YouTube in early March, roughly two weeks before the lockdown was announced in Nepal. Sharma claims that the major purpose of this song was to make people aware, on time before it was too late. He states, “The number of coronavirus infection cases was skyrocketing in many countries and various truthful, as well as misleading, information about this pandemic were everywhere. That is why I felt the need for some initiatives and decided to make a song. This song is solely for the purpose of awareness.”
Sharma adds, “Until any problem becomes serious, we Nepalis rarely care or give attention to it. And, when it becomes serious, we literally get traumatised. Acknowledging this tendency, I made this song using simple day-to-day language that can be understood by everyone.”
Accordingly, he urges his viewers and critics to view this attempt as a public service message about coronavirus prevention rather than a typical song.  He claims, “I was aware that some sections of the audience, as well as critics, would criticise this, accusing me of moneymaking out of a disaster. But my sole aim was to make people aware, as many as I could. That is why I have webcast it on others’ YouTube channels though I own one myself.”
Dozens of others followed Sharma in the next few weeks. In the form of songs, they have talked about symptoms of the infection, preventive measures, and other problems associated with it. Other people behind these creations also say that they had the same purpose in mind: awareness.
Goma Pariyar, a radio journalist who had written a song about the virus, says she had been constantly receiving information about the infection and presenting news about the topic, which made her worried about the appalling situation created by the pandemic in the world. So she thought of doing something from her side, apart from her regular job of informing people. That was when the idea of spreading awareness with a song hit her mind. She says that at the time when she had thought of making this song, there were very few such songs including one by Sharma. She then called her friend, Naresh Khati Chhetri, who became the singer, editor, music arranger, and director for her.
Reception and remarks

Both Sharma and Pariyar inform that their songs have drawn both positive and negative kinds of comments. Further, Pariyar says she is ready to accept negative comments as well. She admits that her song could not be as good as it could be, adding she has received some genuine and logical criticism from her well-wishers. At the same time, she also clarifies that the scarcity of time and the situation during its making could be the possible cause of this outcome.
Many mainstream musicians and singers have also perceived their songs positively. Abhaya Subba, a popular musician and singer, thinks the coronavirus songs are products of the time that the Nepali society is currently going through. “What time or situation demands, music or any piece of art tends to give the same,” she says, “Before the New Year, a number of party songs are made and celebrated while during the hard times, songs of the same emotions are out in the public. This has always been in practice. So, at this uncertain time of the pandemic, the presence of such songs is not surprising.”
Another popular Nepali singer Yash Kumar views such songs as an alternative and effective way of making aware those people who otherwise do not have access to news channels or those who do not prefer to follow the news medium. He says, “Creating songs for awareness is a good thing.”
However, this singer is also critical of such trends. He fears that such a practice of singing songs about anything people talk about may make people liable to utilise serious or critical issues as an opportunity for earning instant popularity. He says, “I do believe no one would use or would have used this critical issue of the Covid-19 as a medium for being popular.”
Sanup Poudel, another talent from the Nepali music industry, stays rather neutral about the trend of Nepali coronavirus songs. “I am not at all interested in the songs which are about the plight the world is going through. Meanwhile, I am also not against the artists’ contribution to the world.”
Audience’s opinions 
Going through various comments such songs have received on YouTube, one can see that the majority of the viewers have liked and praised the songs as well as their messages. But there are also some audience members who have criticised the songs from many perspectives.
Kalpana Sharma, a student who is fond of songs, praises such songs for taking the approach of infotainment. She explains, “Whenever one is stressed or worried or exhausted, they generally prefer to listen to songs. So I feel that such songs can relay the messages in an effective way.”
She further adds, “The same messages delivered through an awareness speech or a news story may bore many people.  For such people, such songs would be the best and effective way to spread information about this pandemic.”
Shanti Kandel, an aspiring singer, shares, “Whichever the songs I have heard about the coronavirus until today, I find them very informative and I like them. I feel like this type of music would clarify people about the symptoms, preventive measures, and other issues related to the disease.”
Prabin Dhungel, a university student, feels ambiguous about such songs. He feels that these songs are a good initiative to spread awareness among people, but also comments that most of these songs are not well executed. For example, the lyrics and visuals are not synchronised well, according to him.
Meanwhile, he also fears that this trend might be another vehicle of ruthless moneymaking business rather than awareness service."

Ten most powerful weapons to effectively manage the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic are the following:
The first and the most powerful weapon to defeat the pandemic is preparedness. The more prepared we are, the more able we will become to defeat the crisis. Preparedness has the following five core dimensions:
Mental preparedness
We need to be mentally and logically prepared to face and defeat the pandemic. Once we are mentally prepared for the worst of the worst version of the pandemic, we can then make sound judgements as to what should be done and what should not, which ultimately enables us to manage all the needful effectively and efficiently on time.
Medical preparedness
After mental preparedness, we need to be medically prepared for the worst version of the pandemic. We need to be fully equipped with adequate ventilators, quarantine and isolation centres, personal protective equipment, hospitals, beds, doctors, nurses, paramedical staffs, medicines, and so on. Once we are medically prepared, we can then significantly minimise both the infection as well as the death rates. For example, the first instance of Covid-19 was traced in Singapore and South Korea much before it was traced in the USA and Europe. However, both these countries could manage to significantly control and contain the spread of infection and the ultimate death. This could be a very inspiring benchmark to the whole world including Nepal.
Logistic preparedness
We should be adequately prepared logistically too in order to face the Covid-19. Not just medical supplies, we need to manage a smooth supply of daily essential commodities and services too.
Structural preparedness
We should also be prepared structurally too in order to face the pandemic, which would imply that we need to have an instrumental pandemic management structure at the central, provincial, and local levels.
Physical preparedness
The physical preparedness implies that all the people should take care of the following seven suggestions in their lifestyle as outlined by the WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus:
After preparedness, the second most important weapon in our fight against the pandemic is patience. We should never be impatient even at the face of crisis as it only goes to deteriorate our capacity to act promptly, effectively, and in a balanced manner. Once we lose patience, we start falling prey to panicking syndrome, which is not good at all.
Calmness is also one of the most powerful weapons in our fight against the pandemic. Being calm means avoiding being desperate and being able to consider the total and holistic picture and make sound judgements. Hence, calmness really helps in our fight.
A rational mind ensures that obvious common sense prevails, and we reach to the conclusions and make decisions based on logic rather than speculations and impulses. A rational mind is always a prerequisite for any good result to be derived and this is more so especially when we are facing some sorts of crisis. Hence, a rational mind is one of the most powerful weapons in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.
A positive environment and a positive mind are of pivotal importance against our fight against the crisis as it helps us make considered, calculated, and proper decisions which are a must in such situations.
Hope is a catalyst of proper action. Once we become hopeless, we tend to feel so drained that we see darkness all around us. Hence, keeping up the hope and trust is a must in this battle.
Confidence always plays a vital role for being successful in anything we do as it is the fundamental driver of perseverance, devotion, and determination, without which we can not become successful in managing anything. This is more so in case of major pandemics like this one.
We live in a society which is so interlinked, and interdepended. The Covid-19 spreads so easily from one person to another. Hence, all the stakeholders such as government mechanisms, political as well as nonpolitical institutions, business enterprises, as well as each citizen should make a united and singular endeavour for us to prevail over this deadly virus.
Collaboration with our friends and partners in the international community is crucial as this is the crisis which is of paramount concern to the whole world. This could help us gather the required knowledge, technology, tools, resources, and infrastructures in our fight against the Covid-19.
Finally, solidarity and international cooperation is also critically important as the outbreak caught the whole world unprepared. Hence, it is important that we foster a level of solidarity against the novel coronavirus which rises above the boundaries of nationalities, religions, ethnicities, economic status, and social status as it has been a really hard-learned lesson that the problem of coronavirus in one part of the world does not remain the problem of that part of the world alone. It may quickly spread into other parts of the world as well in no time.
We need to have ‘one world, one big family, one fight’ approach for the world to combat this virus which has completely disrupted the life of all of us, the whole of humankind."

While the entire world is still trying to control the coronavirus pandemic that has brought everyday life to a grinding halt, nations now scamper trying to assess the full scale of the damages it has caused in its wake. Even though it is still early to fully comprehend the damages both on public health and economic fronts, it is feared that this crisis will be on a never-before-seen magnitude and of a cascading nature, one crisis leading to another, pushing the world into economic and humanitarian chaos of biblical proportions.
Earlier, when the virus was rapidly spreading in developed economies such as Italy, Spain, and the USA, it completely laid-bare the extreme vulnerabilities and the under-preparedness of the governments to take swift measures and save lives. It further exposed governments of even the most developed countries their failure to invest in public health infrastructure. However, rather than putting their utmost priority in investing in rapid testing and isolating the infected and imposing stricter rules in ensuring physical distancing to minimise the infection spread, central banks decided to play by the rulebook of the global financial crisis of 2007-08 and hastily announced trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus.
With the world’s attention now on trying to assess the economic impact and to come up with relief packages worth trillions of dollars, a major chunk of which will have to be financed with more debt through the central bank shoring up their debt buying spree evermore, the next crisis will be many countries defaulting on their debt leading to possible financial contagion. The world is now as more deeply in debt as it was when the last big crisis hit. On the eve of the 2008 crisis, the debt tripled a historic peak of more than three times the size of the global economy. Over the past 11 years, debt levels have soared yet again reaching up to USD 260 trillion versus a global GDP of USD 90 trillion. To increase government spending, countries like Italy and Spain that are already saddled with debt will likely have to borrow more. Therefore, the possibility of them defaulting on their debt looks more likely.
Another cascading crisis arising out of this pandemic is a humanitarian one as there may be a massive rise in refugees due to the rise in hunger and poverty and an increase in terrorism. Also, political upheavals like military coups and far-right extreme nationalist parties gaining more popularity may lead to an increase in hate crimes and racial discrimination against the minorities.
Other cascading risks of this pandemic are a probable downturn in the world economy imposed by the oil-rich economies in the Middle East due to a steep fall in oil prices as demand continues to weaken and production is still ongoing. As this pandemic has not yet fully spread in the developing and emerging economies, the impact to be caused to such nations has not yet been properly assessed. Moreover, due to short-term foreign investments going out of these economies and fluctuations in exchange rates, their macro-economic stability is in peril.
During these unprecedented times, all nations need to join hands in working together to fight this pandemic with an environment of mutual respect and trust and a better exchange of information. Rather than blaming each other and escalating the trade tensions, the leaders of this globalised world need to exhibit exemplary resolve and leadership in working together to minimise the impact of this pandemic.
What is the way forward for Nepal?

With the nation under a complete lockdown for almost three weeks and the possibility of lockdown getting extended for another week, we are still uncertain about how this virus will impact our country both in terms of wreaking havoc on public health and the damages it will inflict on the overall economy. A serious lack of resources to increase testing and isolating and treating the infected and a clear-cut mechanism of contact tracing has not really led us to the full extent of the damages that this virus can cause. Furthermore, the continuous lockdown has further exacerbated the already weakened economy.
Prior to this crisis, we have almost always struggled as an economy due to volatilities in credit creation and with such volatilities with the significant chunk of credit going to the purchase and investment of pre-existing assets such as land. Additionally, with much of our trade depending on India and a fixed parity exchange rate with INR, cross-border flows of short-term capital in India have also led to volatility in exchange rates and trade flows, leading to overall macro-economic instability. Therefore, as we move forward trying to manage this crisis, apart from ensuring rapid implementation of relief packages aimed at the most vulnerable populations through an increase in government spending, direct control over domestic credit supply through a combination of complete electronic payment mechanisms and directing credit created by banks and financial Institutions to the productive sectors of the economy.
The government has taken a very proactive decision to borrow from IMF, World Bank and other donor agencies to make sure it remains in a position to increase spending as a substantial amount is required to provide direct assistance to the most affected people, businesses and the communities. With a very low debt to GDP ratio, the government has ample fiscal space to borrow and spend as revenue collection is expected to take a very hard toll due to the reduction in imports and disruptions in domestic businesses. Apart from the private debt, the government has already announced to raise the public debt worth NPR 1.95 trillion as domestic borrowing through issuance of bonds and debentures, which will be financed mainly through the public and private savings accumulated over the years. Even though it is not fully clear whether the government would be able to raise almost NPR 2 trillion through domestic borrowing, this is nevertheless a highly critical and appreciable move from the government at this critical juncture.
In the long term, the increase in government borrowing can put a heavy burden on the government to pay the interests. However, this can be managed by keeping the market rates low through monetary policy instruments. Yet, the challenge for the government will be to address the demands made for the tax cuts and also keep on increasing the spending to manage this crisis.
As of now, the government is already running a huge surplus of almost NPR 2 trillion. Additionally, to provide more liquidity to the market and to keep the interest rates low, the Nepal Rastra Bank has already made cuts in the benchmark rates. However, in order to ensure this liquidity is appropriately utilised and to spur an already weakened demand, the government has to come out of their shell and start spending freely to keep the economy moving.
We are predominantly an import-driven economy running huge trade and current account deficits every year, which dwindles our foreign currency reserves and threatens our external economic stability. This will be further put to test due to a sharp fall in remittances. In order to cope with this imbalance, the government has to put in place a mechanism to restrict the import of items that are considered luxurious and put quotas on other items to minimise the outflow of foreign currency.
Even during this crisis, to achieve macroeconomic stability through improvement in employment, wages and increase in production, a large chunk of the credit created both publicly and privately has to be controlled and directed towards the productive sectors of the economy such as agriculture, manufacturing industries, tourism and hospitality, etc. These are the sectors that will be hit hardest by this pandemic, but at the same time, to restore job creation and consumer demand, the government through the NRB has to bring forth the necessary directives and mandates for the banks and financial institutions to increase the extension of credit to such productive sectors as much as possible.
This control over domestic credit creation will be ensured further if the government fully enhances the use of electronic payment mechanisms. Electronic payment systems not only help reduce the overall cost of financial intermediation, but also significantly curtail the extent of tax avoidance, which is a major issue for a country like ours.
Moreover, through extensive use of electronic payment systems, proper end-use of credits extended to various productive sectors of the economy can be monitored and ensured at all times, thus helping the government maintain better control of overall credit creation in the system to achieve overall macroeconomic stability."

Nepal’s constitutional human rights watchdog, the National Human Rights Commission, has decided to monitor the situation of human rights across the country during the ongoing lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak and its aftermath.
The commission is partnering with various civil society and professional organisations, namely: Nepal Bar Association, Federation of Nepali Journalists and NGO Federation, in the monitoring.
The commission today formed a high-level human rights monitoring committee under the leadership of its member Govinda Sharma Paudyal. The panel includes representatives from three professional organisations also. Such provincial and district committees will be formed across the district.
The commission’s spokesperson and secretary Bed Bhattarai says it will check the effectiveness of the government initiatives, the availability of health facilities, the status of consumers’ rights and freedom of expression, people’s access to justice, and the responsibilities of the citizens during the crisis."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Kathmandu, April 10
At least two small parties in the country have demanded that the government establish an all-party mechanism to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Two major political parties, ruling Nepal Communist Party and main opposition Nepali Congress, however, have not made any decision about it.
Sajha Party coordinator Rabindra Mishra has been meeting leaders of the big parties lobbying for such a mechanism. He recently met the ruling party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba.
It has been learned that Dahal was positive about the proposal, and he also assured Mishra that he would talk with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli about the issue. Deuba, however, was not clear on how to respond to Mishra’s proposal. Likewise, other influential leaders of the ruling party are also silent about the proposal.
Meanwhile, the Samajwadi Party’s federal council chairman Baburam Bhattarai has also been pressing the leaders for such a mechanism."

Prime ministers of Nepal and India, KP Sharma Oli and Narendra Modi respectively, on Friday, discussed taking care of Nepalis stranded in India, and Indians stranded in Nepal due to the lockdown imposed in both countries to control the coronavirus outbreak.
Oli informs on his Twitter page that both the prime ministers were concerned about the safety of their citizens during a telephone call this afternoon. As the long open border between the two countries has closed for the past few weeks, thousands of Nepalis have been reported stranded in India. Likewise, there are some Indians in Kathmandu and Birgunj of Nepal.
Oli also says the two agreed to further consolidate the cooperation to combat the crisis.
Meanwhile, Nepal also raised the issue of ensuring smooth supply systems during the crisis, according to Oli. On the occasion, he also thanked India for its assistance to Nepal by providing some medicines."

Business for service
“Every day, we leave our house for work. We cater to the people who are unable to buy fruits and vegetables every day due to the lockdown. Like the doctors and police, we are next in line to deal with people,” shares Deepak Ratna Tuladhar who is working as a delivery person for KhetiFood, “The family keeps calling us, asking if we are okay. They ask us to stop working if possible, but this is our duty. It’s for the noble cause, and we will keep doing so.”
Tuladhar is the operation manager for the company but has been temporarily working as a delivery person too. “The work starts as early as 5:30 am for me, and I work through the day. Only when I reach home, the fear of contracting the virus settles in. Despite that, I still find it an empowering experience as I get the privilege to go out, serve and contribute in my own way.”
The government has categorised food as one of the essential services and asked the shops and vendors to operate as normal. On the other hand, it has allocated the areas and time for the markets, requiring people to walk more. Many are confused as to how to manage their daily needs, without crowding the space, without contracting the virus or being held for defying the lockdown. In this situation, those making food deliveries have come to their rescue, bringing their essentials to their doorsteps.
There were a number of food delivery platforms operating even before the lockdown. While some are continuing their work, many have changed their working style a bit to cater to the need of time.
Foodmandu, an online food delivery platform, has introduced its new segment, Foodmandu Fresh, to deliver fresh groceries. The company is partnering with six vendors to collect the fruits and vegetables every morning and deliver them as ordered. Another popular food delivery platform, Bhojdeals, has also changed its module a bit and continued to partner with KK Mart to deliver the essentials. The already available resources, including their websites and apps from where they took the orders, as well as the working modules allowed both the platforms to mobilise quicker and more efficiently, even though the restaurants and cafes they used to partner with are shut down.
Meanwhile, some platforms have changed their operating locations. While employees of Bhojdeals are operating from outlets of KK Mart, KhetiFood, a delivery platform for fruits and vegetables, is operating from a makeshift fulfilment centre inside Patan Industrial Estate after facing some problems in the previous location in Kupondole.
Bhat-Bhateni Supermarket and Salesberry have been delivering their own supplies. So far they have been swamped with delivery requests. Each of the companies receives around 250 delivery requests per day. They say they are ready to continue their service as long as one month though the customers may have to wait for one to two days to get the things delivered.
Other food delivery platforms include Sastodeal, Kirana, Daraz, Nimbus, Durbarmart, Daily Doko, etc.
Ensuring safety during the chaos
Just like the health workers and the security personnel at the frontline, the delivery persons also require the equipment that protects them from contracting the virus. However, unlike the doctors, they do not really require personal protective equipment (PPE) or an N-95 mask, according to the delivery companies. The importance of safety for the delivery is realised by both the delivery personnel and the companies as every employee is given a mask, a pair of gloves and hand sanitiser.
“Safety of our employees as well as the customers is our top priority while making deliveries. We have been practising all the possible safety preventive measures. They are also strictly advised to sanitise their hands every 30 mins and prior to food delivery,” shares Shyam Ratna Mali, Head of Brand, Marketing & Sales for Foodmandu, “We have also requested our customers to use hand sanitiser before accepting their orders. Our vans are disinfected periodically.”
Bhojdeals also follows the same. The company’s CEO and cofounder Niket Agrawal adds, “All staff have been strictly asked to maintain social distancing with the other individuals and take all protective measures as per the WHO guidelines. Temperatures of each team member are checked when they report to duty and after every trip or delivery.”
Salesberry’s Chief Operation Officer Chet Narayan Poudel says they brief the employees on the situation and counsel them on a daily basis to make sure they follow preventive measures. “Only three branches are handling the orders. However, other branches including the smaller stores are operating as before, with limited working hours, while following all the safety precautions for those who visit the stores physically,” he adds.
Meanwhile, KhetiFood’s cofounder Tulsi Giri says it is not easy to adopt all necessary precautions in the crisis, maintaining his company came with a code of conduct from the very beginning, even before lockdown. He says KhetiFood has taken the security of its workers more seriously and has decided to insure the staff for this period.
All the platforms are also encouraging digital payments during delivery to avoid any physical contact. However, from the experience of the delivery persons so far, they say not everyone has adapted to the cashless transaction via payment gateways like Khalti, FonePay, eSewa, etc. Hence, they receive the cash on delivery, but by maintaining distance. Many find this situation unusually dilemmatic.
“In our Nepali culture, it is a norm that we give and receive anything with both of our hands, which means we are respecting them. Given the circumstances, we have to maintain distance. But, people are not really adept at digital transactions and they insist on cash. Hence, they have put the money on the ground and we have to pick up. To avoid any misunderstanding, we explain it to the customers and many comply. But this still creates a strain on social relationships,” shares Deepak Ratna Tuladhar of KhetiFood.
Other problems
But the new mode of transaction is not the only problem that these companies have faced. There are a lot of other problems, of different natures.
Despite the announcement of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli about suspending long-haul public transport and international flights, the announcement for lockdown came rather quickly. Hence, the transition from pre-lockdown to lockdown was a bit bumpy.
“The biggest challenge we faced was in the beginning days [of the lockdown]. All our lower level staffers were already on leave for three days. But farmers from our network already had the stock and we decided to continue. We asked more than 30 staff from Pokhara and Kathmandu to be in their homes while the management team took over. The first week was very difficult as we were working with only 10 people. We got volunteers to meet the need,” shares Giri.
While the delivery companies are struggling to manage human resources, a few customers seem ignorant of the crisis. Poudel informs, “There are people who still order liquor and cigarettes, which we are cancelling. Other than that, we are meeting 90 per cent of the orders.” Several other problems for such platforms include not being able to deliver outside Kathmandu and their own dependence on the farmers outside the city.
Meanwhile, these companies say they are not getting sufficient permits for the vehicles to ply even during the lockdown ferry the goods. “To get the permit, we had to wait in long queues. The government agencies were easy to work with to get the permit; but being stopped and questioned in every point by police, demanding explanations from us was a hassle,” Giri says, “What is tougher is that every week, the government is extending the lockdown and we have to renew permits too. It means we have to go through the whole process again and halt our services in the process. The second extension halted our service for 36 hours and we faced lots of quality issues.” Adding to this, Tuladhar expresses early notice from the government could have been helpful to avoid such situations.
The problem is shared by other companies also. Foodmandu is today using three delivery vans with two delivery persons per vehicle. But, initially, it got only one pass, which was not enough for it to fulfill the demands. It expects to receive more permits for bikes in the coming days.
As Nepal has entered the second phase of coronavirus transmission, all the platforms have the same message to avoid any aggravation. They request all to stay home, stay safe and strongly urge people to use e-commerce platforms to purchase their daily essentials. “Furthermore, I would like to request you to buy only what you need, so the supply is enough for everyone,” adds Mali. Similarly, Agrawal urges other e-commerce and technological platforms to come together and work to ease the flow, in this challenging time.
Meanwhile, Giri believes that local food systems are the way to go forward towards meeting the supply and smoothening the food value chain (i.e. from production to consumption)."

Nepalis working in South Korea have sent various medical supplies including 4,000 coronavirus testing kits to their home country.
The supplies worth Rs 8 million is expected to arrive in Kathmandu on Friday afternoon. Under a call of the Non-resident Nepalis Association (NRNA), the workers had launched a campaign to collect funds for the purchase a few days ago.
Then, the NRNA had signed an agreement with a Korean company to purchase the kits and other equipment.
Symbolically, the NRNA handed over a section of the equipment to be supplied to Nepal, to Nepal’s acting ambassador to South Korea, Ram Singh Thapa, in Seoul on Thursday.
It has been learned that the kits they have sent can detect infection results in three hours."

Kathmandu, April 10
Nepali hoteliers say as many as 1.1 million workers working for them are at the risk of losing jobs due to the coronavirus outbreak worldwide. They complain the government did not take any initiatives to address the industry’s concern.
The Hotel Association of Nepal says the tourism industry is the worst-hit sector by the ongoing crisis and investments worth billions are at risk. Though the government has assured relief and support to cope with the crisis, the relief packages are not friendly to the industry, claims the association.
The association says the hotels only cannot pay the staff, urging the government to take the responsibility of the workers. It says it is the state’s responsibility to revive the tourism industry, which is a crucial component of the national economy."

Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development, Ghanashyam Bhusal, has drawn the attention of the local government bodies to the possibility of famine in the country as the agricultural activities have not been smooth in the wake of coronavirus outbreak.
Minister Bhusal wrote a letter to the chiefs of all 753 local governments in the country, informing that the ban on the export of agricultural produce in many countries and price hikes could result in difficulty to meet the demand in days to come.
“The current situation across the world will result in a decrease in foreign jobs, meaning the number of people returning home will increase while the working-age group here will face difficulty to find employment opportunities. On the other hand, the food production will also decrease. The collective outcome will put the country in a situation where it is unable to meet the demand,” said Bhusal.
Stating that the agricultural sector would be crucial in battling the socio-economic challenges, he informed the local bodies of the five policies the ministry put forward to avoid reaching such a situation. They include equal distribution of relief packages for production, easy loan packages and technological assistance for farmers, insurance of the crops and livestock, and good prices for their production.
Meanwhile, he requested the local bodies to provide information on the local food consumption behaviour, and the possibility of using barren lands."

The Bajhang District Administration Office in Sudurpaschim province has taken action against nine persons including four ward chairmen of a rural municipality in the district for defying the government order of lockdown by organising a festival.
A cultural festival was organised in Chhabis Pathibhara rural municipality of the district on Monday this week and local government officials were found to be involved in it. Following that, the DAO had arrested them.
Chairpersons of wards two, three and four have been handed down a sentence of one-month jail and Rs 100 fine. However, since the law allows anyone receiving the jail sentence shorter than one year to get free by paying Rs 300 for each day of the sentence, they chose to pay the fine for the whole year and get released, Chief District Officer Umesh Pandey says.
Another ward chair, of ward 5, was given a jail sentence of seven days and Rs 100 fine. He also chose to convert the jail sentence into fine."

The famous Rato Machhindranath Jatra in Lalitpur has become the latest victim of the ongoing coronavirus crisis among centuries-old cultural festivals of Kathmandu valley.
Locals of Lalitpur and cultural administrators on Friday have decided to postpone the festival, the longest of chariot festivals in Kathmandu, till the end of the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country. The lockdown is scheduled to end on Wednesday next week, but there is also a possibility of extension.
The festival had begun on Wednesday when the locals offered a holy bath to the god of rain and prosperity.  The locals were scheduled to begin the construction of the chariot today.
But, Guthi Sansthan and Jyapu Samaj Yala decided to postpone the process. They say the chariot construction would begin after the end of lockdown after offering a kshamapuja, a religious function to be held to request the god for forgiveness.
The annual festival lasts for 15 days.
Before this, Bisket Jatra and Jibro Chhedne Jatra of Bhaktapur and Seto Machhindranath Jatra of Kathmandu have also been postponed for this year. Locals of Ason in Kathmandu also did not celebrate the annual Paachahre festival last month."

The breaking news on March 26 was that the United States leads the world in confirmed coronavirus case. This fact shook me. While I am writing this, the US number rises to 188,172 infected cases and 3,899 deaths (Source: Coronavirus Resource Centre, John Hopkins University and Medicine).
Sadly, all these numbers will increase. The world is topsy-turvy since MIT prohibited international travel and non-essential domestic travel on March 06, 2020, and interstate travel restriction on March 19. The Massachusetts governor declared a state of emergency on March 10. I got the news while on a site visit to Boston Harbour. Since then, my mind has not been at ease, and nothing is as I thought it would be.
The coronavirus pandemic has changed my life from a SNAFU (situation normal all fouled up) a couple of weeks ago to a FUBAR (fouled up beyond all recognition) drama. Only one month ago, my plan was to finish classes at the end of April, and I was busy arranging much-anticipated travel to Toronto, Atlanta, Houston, and Arizona and looking forward to another non-local professional affiliation in Washington, DC. I was excited that my parents would come to Cambridge to attend my SPURS graduation on May 01. My parents had already travelled from Nepal on February 4 to be with relatives in Texas and were planning to come here to be with my daughter and me. But now, everything has been disrupted. Neither my parents nor I am allowed to meet or stay together.
All plans needed to be changed abruptly. My daughter’s public elementary school in Cambridge has closed. MIT has closed all in-person classes, meetings, and events; even the SPURS workroom for fellows is closed. All classes for us are now online. The institute has encouraged all of us who live in MIT graduate housing to leave if we can, but this is the US home for my daughter and me, so we continue living in an MIT graduate building which is now largely vacant since most American graduate students have left.  Neither my parents nor I and my daughter can currently fly back to Nepal due to travel restrictions. So, all my plans are uncertain.
I am attempting to determine the best for my family and professional career while complying with all edicts and regulations. While I know public officials and MIT are attempting to find a delicate balance between prudence and actions that may cause panic, it is hard to live with so much uncertainty. My friend Richard MacIntosh, a local American, also cannot clarify but uses clichés and looks to the American character for answers.
I have had mixed experiences with the government and the university in this Covid-19 crisis. I realise that I am dealing with bureaucracies which are self-protective. I have found at a personal level that Americans are kind, considerate, and generous. People whom I know casually are calling daily to enquire about my well-being. Others are generously helping me with day-to-day activities. However, I am also bombarded with emails and find I am spending an inordinate amount of time reading, interpreting, and worrying about how to comply. I wish that it would all go away so I could concentrate on my fellowship work.
I have found myself a very resilient person in the past. Even now, when I get away from the overwhelming communications, I find my sense of reality and humour returning. But then the emails bring contradictory instructions, and I feel overwhelmed by the difficulty of making plans and figuring out what is best for me and my daughter day-by-day. What I see is that Americans are making every attempt to keep their lives normal. I see them walking, talking, cycling, wheeling baby-carriages, and walking their dogs each time I leave the MIT apartment building. At the same time, the local grocery store, Trader Joe’s in Cambridge, has been full of people who look anxious while maintaining the social distance.
In much of the US, people have started working from home, closing schools, switching to online classes, cancelling conferences, and ‘visiting’ family only electronically. The federal and local governments are working hard to protect people, but the disease is escalating here. It is distressing to write that the US has become the epicentre of the global pandemic, overtaking both China and Italy.

Political, financial, engineering and medical institutions have been disrupted globally. Experts are warning the most severe impact has yet to come. Scientists are researching for effective, safe medicines and vaccines to stop it. We must hope for the best and prepare for the worst outcomes. The course is not a straight line, but, rather, zig-zags as the US does not have strong central planning except during war times. It will be interesting, decades from now, to see how the politicians and historians treat the actions of each government around the world and argue about what system was the most effective. I am not cheering for any particular ideology, but want the human race to be the winner. May we learn to use the best that each country has to offer. The United States is finding its way forward in its usual bumbling way. This is okay since we are making progress, however.
Finally, I need to comment on the impact of this pandemic on the national security of the US. This crisis will cause each country, the US in particular, to review its stance on globalisation. That is, the interdependency of countries will be reassessed. National interests will be emphasised, once again. This has been highlighted by the US, depending on China for much of its health supplies and antibiotics. It now finds it needs to find alternatives. This dependency cannot continue as the two countries are both economic and political rivals. The supply chains will be realigned to give the US greater independence. This will affect the Pacific region as China will play a lesser role while other Asian Pacific countries will seize this opportunity to grow. This will have an immediate effect and will continue to evolve for decades. I trust that the business and political leaders of Nepal will see the future clearly and will act in the best interests of the Nepali people."

The government has withdrawn its decision to let people stranded in Kathmandu leave the city for other districts of the country.
The decision was withdrawn after the Ministry of Home Affairs advised implementing it would not be possible. Likewise, various stakeholders including Province 5 Chief Minister Shankar Pokhrel had also protested the decision.
“Now, understand that this [leaving Kathmandu for other districts] is not possible immediately,” Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Basanta Kumar Nembang confirms.

Kathmandu, April 9
Owing to some recent reports that many workers in Kathmandu are leaving the city for the various districts after they lost their job in the lockdown, the government has decided to let people stranded in Kathmandu, who want to go to their houses in other parts of the country, leave Kathmandu on Friday and Saturday.
A meeting of the high-level committee to control the coronavirus outbreak led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokharel made the decision.
Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Basanta Kumar Nembang, says the government will drop the passengers at various stations of major highways.
However, the government will not let the people who are currently outside Kathmandu come back to the valley, according to him.
Earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs was mulling over whether to let people leave the city gradually.
A source in the Ministry of Home Affairs says the ministry studied likely positive and negative results of the decision. A recent meeting of the high-level committee to control the coronavirus outbreak had recently assigned the ministry to make a decision in this regard, and accordingly, the ministry had formed a task force for the study, the official informs."

Police in the Saptari district of southeastern Nepal have detained 25 people after they were found continuing their movement during the nationwide lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus crisis also. The arrestees include nine Nepalis and 14 Indians.
Police arrested them in Bhardaha, Hanumannagar Kaikalani municipality-1 of the district.
Earlier last night, locals around Chandani Chok in Krishna Sawaran rural municipality-6 had seen the Indian nationals sleeping on a chaurata.
The locals then informed the ward chair Tej Narayan Yadav. “I asked them to be quarantined, but they did not,” he said. Following the incident, the ward chair called the police and detained them.
In the meantime, they also found a group of nine Nepalis travelling on a pickup van. Both groups have been quarantined at a local school."

Gandaki Chief Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung telephoned a patient of Covid-19 in Baglung district of the province on Thursday and took stock of her health.
The young woman from the district, who had recently returned home from Belgium, had tested positive for the virus around one week after her return flight. She is currently being treated at Dhaulagiri Hospital in the district.
During the call, Gurung advised her to drink a lot of water and take care of her health, assuring the government would provide ‘good treatment’ for her.
“Rest assured that you will be cured. Stay calm and don’t panic. Yours is not a critical case,” Gurung told her, “But, please don’t think you will be out of the hospital in 14 days. You may have to stay a few days longer. Once you are healed, you will go home.”"

The government has urged the civil servants except those working for the emergency services to contribute to the government while staying home during the lockdown.
The government has directed them to communicate with their immediate supervisors via telephone and internet-based mediums and do office works from home.
The Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration also urged the staff to help the families and communities abide by the government’s order for lockdown. The staff have also been requested to help the society adopt the necessary precautions to protect itself from the outbreak.
They have also been told to contribute to the concerned local bodies’ works regarding relief distribution to the needy during the crisis."

As the nationwide lockdown introduced to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country is being extended time and again, it is not yet certain when the educational institutions including schools, colleges, and universities will reopen.
Considering that, the government is preparing to promote distance education during this period, informs Minister for Education, Giriraj Mani Pokharel. He says televisions, radios, and online platforms will be used to teach the students.
“We are preparing to make sure that the students enjoy their right to learning even during the crisis,” Pokharel says, “Teaching in the traditional methods will not be enough for this.”
Meanwhile, the government has also formed a committee to prepare immediate, mid-term and long-term plans about distance learning in Nepal. The 13-member committee is headed by Lekhnath Sharma, the vice-chancellor of Nepal Open University.
Sharma says the committee has already begun its assignment."

The government has clarified that industrialists can open their factories and enterprises even during the lockdown provided they have adopted sufficient health and security precautions. However, the industrialists have expressed unwillingness to open the factories citing various problems.
The Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies has said the factories can open with a provision of barring the workers, as a quarantine site. But, the owners fear that it only increases their costs and managing the staff will be complicated.
Rajesh Kaji Shrestha, the president of Nepal Chamber of Commerce, says opening other businesses does not make any sense now while all trade activities and supply systems are closed. He maintains that the factories producing and marketing essential goods are still open.
Another industrialist on the condition of anonymity fears the staffers might not be ready to join their work thinking many are paid while being at home.
“Likewise, managing the workers in a big number within the factory, by maintaining the social distance is not easy,” Satish Kumar Moore, the president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, says."

After weeks-long efforts by the government of Nepal, China has finally agreed to reopen the Tatopani border point between its Tibet autonomous region and Nepal.
As the country is on a lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak and the border points with India have been closed to control the human movement, the country is facing hardship in bringing supplies. The border points connected with China were also closed since January as China was facing the crisis.
However, as China gradually improved its situation, Nepal has been making efforts to reopen the border points. But, the Chinese authorities had not shown willingness to reopen the points as the number of infected cases in Nepal was improving.
But, from Wednesday night, the Tatopani border point is open, informs Sindhupalchok’s Assistant Chief District Officer Baburam Khanal. He says the authorities have established health desks at the point as recommended by the World Health Organisation.
Meanwhile, Nepal imported some packets of sanitiser and masks via the border point yesterday. Tatopani Customs Office chief Lal Bahadur Khatri says these goods in the big quantity will be imported tomorrow.
For now, China has allowed the export of essentials only, according to him.
‘Rasuwagadhi not to open now’
Meanwhile, the Chinese government officials have said they will not open the Rasuwagadhi border points anytime soon.
An official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says China has clarified that it will open the Tatopani border point only for now. The Chinese government, however, has not told why it chose Tatopani, but not Rasuwagadhi, to open."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party leader and former finance minister Prakash Chandra Lohani has suggested that the government should cut down on the salaries of the president, the prime minister, and all other lawmakers to manage the fund to respond to the coronavirus crisis in the country.
In an interview with Onlinekhabar, Lohani says if the government decides to cut down on the salaries of these officials by 25 per cent for one year, there will not be any shortage of money to fight back the crisis.
He views that the salaries of all officials of the constitutional bodies should be cut down for one year. However, the payments of junior government employees such as security personnel and civil servants at the grassroots should not be reduced, according to him.
Lohani also demands that the government invest the fund allocated for the lawmakers’ Constituency Development Programme on the Covid-19 response."

Baburam Thapa, 34, from Ribdikot of neighbouring Palpa district had died in the hospital during treatment. It has already been confirmed that he was not infected with the novel coronavirus.
Following the incident, the family members and local cadres of the Nepali Congress party had been claiming that he died because of the hospital’s negligence. They had said they would not receive the body unless the government launched an independent probe into the incident and ensured compensation to the deceased’s family.
However, the family signed a five-point agreement with the provincial government officers in Butwal, and agreed to receive the body. In the agreement, the government has agreed to establish a fund to support the family. The government has also agreed to education the deceased’s two sons and give a job to the widow."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "

The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Along with launching the Ultrabooks with Xiaomi branding, the company also has released new laptops that are much more affordable compared to the Ultrabooks. The two laptops–Redmi Book 15 and 15 Pro–share similar build and specifications. Both of them feature an 11th gen processor and provide HD display and durable battery life.
Let’s get into the details of Redmi Book 15 and Book 15 Pro.
Specifications
Redmi Book 15 and Book 15 Pro are virtually identical in terms of designs and only some specifications separate them from each other. The laptop has a metallic brush finish that gives the laptop a neat look. Redmi branding has been done on the outer lid of the laptop. 
Talking about the ports, both laptops feature 1 x USB 2.0, 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 1 x HDMI 1.4, 1 x RJ45 (LAN port) and 1 x 3.5mm audio jack.
The laptop has a thickness of 19.9mm and weighs around 1.8kg.
Redmi Book 15 and Book 15 Pro feature a 15.6-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1,920*1,080 pixels. It also features a 720p resolution HD webcam. With a 1.5mm deep key travel keyboard, the trackpad on the laptop is also wide and supports multi-touch gestures.

The government is planning to spend Rs 9.27 billion for projects that fall under the Millennium Challenge Corporation in the fiscal year 2022-23.
According to the Ministry of Finance, it has doubled the budget for the US-funded MCC project compared to Rs 4.29 billion for the current fiscal year.
Despite continuous protest, the MCC was passed by the House of Representatives this year.
The government is spending the budget on acquiring land for road and transmission line projects.
Out of the budget set for this year, Rs 8.91 billion will be US grant and Rs 365.6 million will be spent by the government of Nepal. Most of the money for this project is spent on capital purposes."
"
The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Nowadays, everybody appears to be so stuck, worried, and engaged in talking, reading, writing, speaking, and listening about Covid-19 and that alone. The psychological irony of any prolonged adverse development of any sort is that the loss of confidence, trust, positivity, calmness, and rational thinking becomes much more severe and significant than the actual loss in terms of financial, physical, or human lives. This article attempts to shed some lights regarding withstanding Covid-19 from a philosophical standpoint
We have witnessed a lot of terrific development and losses a few times in the world history. If we take a moment to reel back to the world history, we will find that some events were more fatal than Covid-19 in different decades and centuries across the globe. For instance, humankind has already survived the two world wars, economic recessions, major political revolutions, to name a few. Even in terms of health pandemics, we have survived many. The table below encompasses a few of the major health pandemics that had occurred in the world history.
Source: www:history.com/news/pandemics, www:nhs.uk/condition/sars, www: cdc.gov/flu/pandemic,  www:livescience.com/worst-epandemics, www:visualcapitalist.com
So, let us pause for a moment and just imagine how those people felt during those tough times? Who could survive and made a speedy recovery and bounce back quickly and how? What sort of mindset was fruitful and what sort of mindset was not fruitful? Obviously, the ones who could manage somehow to remain calm, positive, and hopeful even amidst the crisis were the ones who could survive and bounce back quickly.
Even in Nepal, if we recall all major political as well as economic turning points and try to figure out what sort of mindset was beneficial and what sort of mindset was not beneficial, we will deduce the same conclusion.
It is obvious and proven time and again in the history that the survivors and the winners are highly spirited by calmness, positivity, and confidence.
Hence, let us all embrace the same virtues to protect ourselves from Covid-19. Needless to mention, the advice pertaining to precautions to be taken is obviously not to be forgotten.
Let us closely analyse the facts:
The mortality rate for age group below 60 years is only 2.30% and that for age group above 60 years is 33.50%.
The mortality rate of Covid-19 is much lower as compared to other viruses. The countries that immediately focused on carrying out test, arranging personal protective equipment, and contact tracing and isolation (for example Australia, Canada, South Korea, Norway, Israel, Germany) could contain the spread and minimise death.
India announced nationwide lockdown for 21 days on March 24 after detecting the first confirmed case on January 30. India has so far been highly successful in containing the spread of the virus and minimising the death despite having a population of more than 1.30 billion and despite lacking sufficient medical infrastructures as compared to other developed countries.
China being the epicentre of the virus has been highly successful in getting through it. Ambitious, agile, aggressive and harsh steps were taken by the Chinese government like immediate lockdown of major cities, swift steps in construction of dedicated hospitals, pooling and concentrating the healthcare workers in hardest hit areas, aggressive social distancing measures and contact tracing and isolation and mass testing measures etc. Two widely used mobile phone apps, AliPay and WeChat, also helped enforce the restrictions, because they allow the government to keep track of people’s movements and even stop people with confirmed infections from traveling.
Colour codes on mobile phones—in which green, yellow, or red designate a person’s health status—let guards at train stations and other checkpoints know who to let through. In the end, infected people rarely spread the virus to anyone but members of their own household. Once all the people in an apartment or home were exposed, the virus had nowhere else to go and chains of transmission ended.
The WHO says Covid-19 is still an unclear infectious disease, which means we can only obtain an accurate prediction after the outbreak ends. The outbreak spreads are largely influenced by each country’s policy and social responsibility. As data transparency is crucial inside the government, it is also our responsibility not to spread unverified news and to remain calm in this situation.
Further studies need to be done to help contain the outbreak as soon as possible.  This outbreak is assumed to reach its peak in late May 2020 and will start to drop around early July 2020.

Progress regarding vaccines and medicines
Source: FDA, WHO and Company Website
In Nepal, there are nine cases, including eight imported and one local. Around 2,000 persons have been tested. As of April 2, there are 97 hospitals, 26,587 quarantine beds and 3,113 isolation beds.
There are obviously many shortcomings and capacity gaps as Nepal’s capacity for combating the deadly virus is concerned if we compare it with that of developed countries. However, one interesting fact is that the spread of virus and the death toll have, not so far, been directly proportional to the economic, social, and medical infrastructures in place in the country.  There is no denying that despite being located between China and India, Nepal has been, so far, hugely successful in containing the spread of the virus. Despite having numerous rooms for improvements, the actions undertaken by Nepal for combating Covid-19 so far is nevertheless satisfactory.
Having said so, Nepal’s failure in significantly enhancing testing capabilities, contact tracing and quarantine capabilities, and availability of adequate personal protective equipment, (isolation centers, ventilators and medicines) should not be forgotten. The country, now, should also capitalise on the great global success stories of countries like China, South Korea, Canada, Germany, Norway, Vietnam, Israel, and Singapore etc, to name a few.
The call of the hour is indeed a unified nationwide drive by rising above all interests, backgrounds, and ideologies to combat the crisis.
In the ecosystem of the earth, every creature/species, and every other thing has been incredibly and perfectly balanced. When a balance starts to shake, Mother Nature has her own ways of mending and restoring the balance. Maybe, the ongoing crisis is also a part of that ecosystem.
There are many other burning issues too in the planet we all live in, for instance: the issue of climate change, depleting ozone layers, rising sea levels, melting Himalayas over the extraction of natural resources, social and political inequalities, people living below the poverty line and not having access to even basic rights and amenities, etc. These issues are collectively posing a significant threat to global peace, harmony and stability. These issues have led to various natural calamities across the globe in the form of health hazards, floods, tsunamis, landslides, and extinction of many species in different periods of time.
So the devastation caused by Covid-19 can be understood in a couple of positive dimensions too in the sense that it has pushed the whole world and all of us to rethink everything from politics, to policy, to harmony, to equitable distribution of developmental dividends etc. Any situation of crisis is also, in disguise, an opportunity to review, revisit, and revalidate everything which would then ultimately lead to more inclusion, justice, unity, peace, stability, and ecological balance and harmony, all of which collectively will yield rich social as well as economic dividends in the long run.
Hence, let’s all also try to see the positive aspects of the ongoing pandemic and feel some relief.
The terrific part of any catastrophe is that it sabotages our ability to think above and beyond the ongoing devastation. However, everything comes to an end sooner or later. If we remain too engaged in the devastation and could not see the world after that, obviously, we will feel trapped by the darkness and darkness alone even though there will always be prospects, a life, and future after the end of each catastrophe.
So while facing the Covid-19 pandemic, we should always be mindful that this, like any other catastrophe in the history, will also come to an end sooner or later and we should try to foresee the light, life, and future after the end of the ongoing pandemic. This could boost a sense of hope, positivity, and confidence and enable us to remain patient and calm so that we can bounce back swiftly for even greater good.
Hence, let’s all know that in the journey of our lives, this is only an event and not the whole life itself. Once we get through this pandemic, there are a huge bunch of beautiful prospects, opportunities, and discoveries and we should always keep up the hope, positivity, and confidence.
‘Preparing’ means assembling all the tools, and resources required to face an event so that when one faces it one is fully prepared to eliminate or minimise the troubles and losses arising from that event. On the other hand, ‘panicking’ means acting in despair, losing hope, and acting unnecessarily desperately. Preparing is always good whereas panicking never helps.
So, in order to smartly face the current pandemic, we should be well prepared. However, we should never panic. When we know the difference between preparing and panicking, we get a fair idea as to what should be done and what should not.
Hence, let’s make sure that we are preparing but not panicking and remain calm, positive, and confident.
Being rational means ensuring that an obvious common sense prevails so that we can make logical decisions. When one tries to be rational, one can correlate the cause and impact well and make proper and warranted decisions.
So, in the context of ongoing pandemic, we should utilise our common sense well and should not run after the rumours, fake news, and speculative notions and opinions.
Hence, let us all remain rational and make sure that we judge all the information and situation rationally by utilising our common sense, logical reasoning, and critical thinking. This will also prevent us from being impulsive and protect us from a lot of negativities.
Whenever one tries to rise above the ongoing crisis and carefully analyse and evaluate the outcomes of various actions that one can opt to do today, one gets a fair idea as to what is good to do now and what is bad.
In order to keep us cool, calm, focused, disciplined and determined even amidst the ongoing pandemic, we should try to have a constructive and pragmatic mindset instead of allowing ourselves to be ruined by negative thoughts, emotions, and news.
Hence, let us all figure out what is good and what is bad for us. This will help us make sure that the senses continue to prevail in everything we do, and we do not lose calmness, patience, and hope.
Many times, one may fall victim to the fear of the unknown. One may not be able to exactly figure out what can go wrong in the best case, most likely case and worst-case scenarios. In the absence of that, one cannot fully prepare for the worst thing that can possibly happen and plan, prepare and act accordingly.
All of us operate in a very uncertain world. Nobody has a sure idea as to what will happen in the future in our family, society, country, and the whole world as we surge ahead in our lives. There are so many uncertainties in our lives even without any pandemic. Hence, we should always try to analyse and evaluate the best case, most likely case, and worst-case scenarios. This will help us make more wise, farsighted, considered, calculated, and scientific actions and decisions. Even amidst the ongoing crisis, we are knowingly or unknowingly making some of the decisions, which we may regret after a few years.
Hence, let us hold ourselves for a moment and try to analyse and evaluate the best case, most likely case, and worst-case scenarios that can happen and plan and prepare ourselves accordingly. This could help us ensure that we continue to remain prudent, wise, and farsighted even at the face of the ongoing pandemic. This could relieve our stress and anxieties. In most of the occasions, in the end, nothing is as dreadful as we could have thought in the middle of a crisis. We may have fallen victim to the fear of the unknown which could have sabotaged our mind and emotions and led to desperate reactions.
Humans are social creatures. The context explains the background of anything, and the environment determines the context. If anything good or bad is a relative measure and benchmarks are developed taking reference of the environment. What we consider good in Nepal may not be considered good in other parts of the world. Our perception of truth is always influenced by our social structures, practices, religion, value system, and the belief system which can be collectively termed as socio-cultural environment.
We all have the tremendous influence of socio-cultural environment upon us. If the environment that we operate in is positive, we generally tend to have positive feelings and vice versa. Even at the face of Covid-19 pandemic, some countries and individuals are positive, some others are neutral, and some others are negative too. This has tremendously impacted the effectiveness of their actions and decisions to face and overcome the pandemic. Every situation including the pandemic is certainly a management situation. Some have managed it excellently, others have managed it reasonably well, and others have managed it poorly. Accordingly, the results are varied.
Hence, we should promote a positive environment all around us as it impacts tremendously on how we feel, decide, and act in a situation. This will tremendously help us effectively face and manage the pandemic as once the environment is positive, our decisions are more likely to be considered, calculated, and scientific.
Positive environment is important. However, should one move with the environment the way it is now, or should one emerge as an anchor of positivity? ‘Go with the flow’ may not help in tough times. One needs to emerge as an anchor of positivity, hope, and confidence. This is extremely important as most of the people turn negative, less hopeful, less positive, and less confident while facing a major crisis. This in turns drives the entire environment to be the same and in turn even a neutral person starts to enter the zone of negativity. Then, a vicious cycle of negativity comes into play, further worsening the environment and people’s mindset with sharp depletion in collective wisdom, positivity, and hope.
We should understand that when the environment is not that positive, we should emerge as an anchor of positivity, hope, and confidence and spread the same all around us which will gradually be replicated in many other people’s mind ultimately turning the whole environment to be positive and a positive cycle comes into play.
Hence, the best way to face the current pandemic is being an anchor of positivity and helping the entire environment to be positive in turn. With positivity comes hope, confidence, and rational decision making, ultimately leading to better management of the crisis.
We just talked about a positive environment and need to emerge as a positivity anchor. However, we could also think that how can one change the notion and mindset of so many people and the whole environment. This is exactly where one needs to remember and reinforce that everything starts from one. Even this deadly pandemic started with one and went on to be so viral all over the world. All the great inventions, and transformations were made possible by a sheer coordinated endeavour of so many people. However, one should never also forget that all of them also started from one individual who believed and persisted and gradually formed a team.
One of the most powerful tools to fight this pandemic is certainly a positive mindset, with which comes a can-do attitude, hope, and confidence. All of these are basic prerequisites for anything good to happen.
Hence, amidst this crisis, we should understand the power of “one”. We should then proceed to multiply one many-fold and accumulate collective energy, which then becomes so powerful that it can defeat any crisis. The Covid-19 will obviously not be an exception to it.
In the current situation, the calling of civic duty is empathy on the part of all of us.
Empathise your family (focus on being constructive and productive)
We should empathise with our family and focus on being constructive and productive even at the face of such a terrific pandemic. We should utilise this lockdown in several constructive and productive ways that are important to ourselves, our family, and for the collective learning, and development of each member of the family, which will yield rich dividends later in our lives.
Empathise fellow citizens

We should also empathise fellow citizens by living in sensible, safe, and meaningful ways and at the same time helping other citizens to live safely and meaningfully. If all of us could empathise all other fellow citizens, issues of overstocking, black marketing, and many forms of injustice would gradually disappear in the long run.
Empathise government
Finally, we should also empathise our government. We should never forget that even the most developed countries and their governments are struggling to respond to the pandemic effectively. It is not that our government is acting adequately, effectively, and efficiently or vice versa. But, we need to have a partnering spirit with our government. We need to fully support the government and all its initiatives aimed at combating the crisis. Whatever way our government might be, this is obviously not the right time to waste our most precious time in arguments, criticisms, and sensitisations. Instead, the calling of the time now is an unprecedented unity, collaboration, and solidarity from all of us, all the Nepali citizens from all over the country, irrespective of differences in political ideology, caste, gender, class, age, or the like.
All of us should embody the spirit of ‘all for one’ and ‘one for all’ in all the plans, actions, and activities aimed at defeating the crisis. Divided we lose and united we win.

The transmission of viruses can be affected by factors, like altitude, climatic conditions (temperature and humidity), population density, age and gender of people, and the medical care quality. People residing at higher altitudes have higher risks of hospitalisation and death due to Covid-19 infection. At high altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen declines leading to respiratory stress. High temperatures and high humidity can successfully reduce the transmission of the virus. The arrival of summer and rainy seasons in the northern hemisphere may therefore effectively reduce the outbreak of Covid-19. In contrast, both cold and dry weather conditions weaken the human immune system, making them susceptible to viral attacks. However, if people stay at home for most of their time under the restrictions of isolation policy, weather conditions will hardly influence virus transmission due to no chance of contact between people.
Socially, large and densely populated areas with widespread poverty and high migration rates are the most vulnerable populations for the infection. The existing epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria along with Covid-19 may further lead to increased morbidity and mortality.
Mathematical modelling has further revealed that the disease extended itself in cities and regions in a narrow east-west side of the world, roughly along 30-50o N’ latitude having an average temperature between 5-11oC and low humidity levels (specific: 3-6 g/kg and absolute: 4-7 g/m3). Soon after China, the new epicentres of disease were South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Northern Italy (all roughly along 30-50o N’ latitude). Thereafter the disease covered the Northwestern United States, Spain, and France, all along 30-50o N’ latitude. However, the virus failed to spread to countries immediately north (such as Russia and Mongolia) and south of China. The number of patients and reported deaths in Southeast Asia is still much less than those in temperate regions. All such findings reveal that using weather modelling, it is possible to predict countries most likely to be at a higher risk of Covid-19 outbreak in upcoming weeks, allowing for the concentration of public health efforts on surveillance and containment.

The Province 5 government has fired five doctors of Lumbini Provincial Hospital on the charge of failing to report to duty during this critical time of coronavirus outbreak.
Those taken action against include Bardan Wali and Tara Prasad Sharma of the radiology department, Prakash Neupane of the ENT department, Subas Chandra Chaudhary of the urosurgery department and Prakriti Karki of the emergency department. All of those were working for the hospital located in Butwal, the provincial capital, on a contract basis.
“They were absent without informing the hospital administration,” the hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Rajendra Khanal says, “Then, Social Development Minister Sudarshan Baral instructed us to immediately sack them.”
Minister Baral says he has been checking the hospital staff’s attendance daily. He says he has directed the government hospitals in the province to sack the doctors and other staff if they take leave except in the cases of childbirth, bereavement, and sickness."

The main opposition leader in Parliament, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has urged the government to make sure that the purchase of all medical equipment needed for the country’s Covid-19 response is transparent and fair.
The former prime minister’s comment comes days after the government annulled an agreement signed with a private company after various media and public suspected that it amounted to corruption. Following that, the government has assigned the Nepal Army to bring the supplies, but many have doubted if the process will be transparent.
In an interview with a news agency on Wednesday, the Nepali Congress president also demanded that the government initiate discussions with stakeholders about how long the lockdown should go.
He urged the government to expand the sample testing further and address the concerns of Nepalis stranded abroad."

Influential Nepali Congress leader Gagan Thapa has asked 11 questions to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli over his address to the nation on Tuesday.
The opposition leader on his Twitter page says Oli’s address failed to clarify various confusions of the public.
Oli had addressed to the nation yesterday informing that the government was seriously fighting the coronavirus outbreak in the country, and urging everyone to support the government initiatives.
Here is a summary of Thapa’s questions:
How do you ensure the quality and effectiveness of kits and other equipment to be used in the rapid test for coronavirus? What is your plan for the tests? How do you train the health workers for them?
What is the status of contact tracing and documentation?
Why don’t you take initiatives to bring all Nepalis stranded across the border back to the country and quarantine them in available facilities?
How is the government preparing to manage the Nepalis currently stranded in India if they come back home after the lockdown in India ends?
How are Nepali diplomatic missions abroad looking after the Nepalis living in their host countries?
What is the status of the availability of personal protective equipment for the doctors and other health workers here?
How is the government preparing to manage available facilities and human resources to combat the crisis? How do you ensure that the regular health services are available for the public smoothly?
What is the plan for the security of security personnel?
How will the government ensure smooth agricultural activities in the country?
Why do you think that people’s concerns over the medical equipment purchase controversy are just baseless and sponsored accusations?
Won’t you again accuse anyone of propagandism when they tell the government to correct its mistakes?"

Kathmandu, April 8
The nationwide lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country has resulted in a sudden decrease in the amount of power consumption in the past month. Consequently, the government-owned power distribution monopoly, Nepal Electricity Authority, has faced a big loss.
Usually, the authority distributes around 20,000 megawatt-hour power per day. After the lockdown was announced on March 23, the daily power distribution has fallen to around 14,000 megawatt-hours. It will cause a loss of around Rs 2 billion in the authority’s revenues in one month, according to authority sources.
The authority’s spokesperson Prabal Adhikari says the authority faced the big blow as most of the businesses including manufacturing factories, hotels and other big consumers of power are shut in the lockdown. He says the domestic consumption of power, however, is intact.
Though the number of families using induction stoves has reportedly increased, it has not affected the overall system, according to Adhikari.
Meanwhile, the authority has not been able to collect its regular revenues since its staff have not visited individual houses to read the metres. Hence, consumers have not been able to pay their monthly bills.
For want of money then, the authority has been unable to pay private power producers on time for the amount of electricity it purchased from them."

The widespread proliferation of Covid-19 seems to escalate each day across the globe. Currently, there is no known vaccine to stop the infection or boost our immune system against this deadly virus. In trying times like these, we have to cope with stress, fear, anxiety and should act rationally and dispassionately. This is the time when fitness and our body’s natural defences are most needed.
Our immune system is a complicated grid of body cells, tissues, chemicals, and organs, which combine to keep us healthy and safe from diseases by guarding us against contagious micro-organisms. In other words, it’s our body’s defence mechanism against viruses, infections, and illnesses.
Immunity, food, and nutrition
Good health starts with the food on your plate. But only eating food packed with nutrients does not help. A good night’s sleep and regular exercise regimen should also take foremost priority to keep ourselves strong, alive and kicking.
“Since it is a virus (coronavirus) which has never mutated in human beings before, there is no current solution to it. Prevention is the best way. How we keep our immune system strong will not just help us with coronavirus but everyday bugs that exist all around us as well as pollution, contamination in food,” said Luke Coutinho, a globally renowned holistic lifestyle coach, and an award-winning holistic nutritionist.
The daily food you have been taking is maybe nourishing enough to keep you healthy. You might, however, like to have a look at some of those foods that may add a little more to your diet in terms of nutrition and the potency to boost your immune system.
No single food or the food mentioned below is a panacea for the coronavirus, but years of research by scientists have established the nutritious value and the immune-building properties found in them, which may help keep bacteria and infections at bay and make you strong and healthy.
The matter requires all the more urgent vigilance and action if you fall into the risk factor such as above 50 years, have an underlying illness like diabetes or hypertension.
Turmeric
We all know about ground turmeric, besar in Nepali and haldi in Hindi, simply because it is a mainstay of Nepali as well as Indian cookery (Read the full story).
Turmeric has an ancient history of being used as a medicinal herb with healing properties, both in Nepali and Indian traditions. You must have tried the piping hot turmeric, ginger and salt concoction untold times, a home remedy for cold and cough.
The ‘science of life’ Ayurveda propounds turmeric helps balance the three energetic forces of nature: the Vata (wind energy), Pitta (fire energy) and Kapha (water energy), collectively called the Dosha. From a simple cold to digestion, asthma, anemia to diabetes, cholesterol and even cancer prevention and management, turmeric is said to help as a healing force.
The secret behind the goodness of turmeric lies in ‘curcumin’, the naturally occurring potent ingredient found in turmeric, which is said to work as an anti-inflammatory agent. Researchers maintain curcumin’s antiviral and antibacterial activity helps counteract various important human pathogens like the influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV and strains of Staphylococcus.

Although it’s an open secret that we take turmeric every day as it’s used in our cooking, maybe there is no harm in adding a pinch or two of it more to your dal (lentils) or curry or try it with hot water first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Maybe you might fancy a fad-drink, golden latte, to stimulate your palate.
Garlic
If you believe in Ayurveda, garlic is recognised as a fundamental element for the making of its medicines. It produces heat in the body and is said to purify our blood.  It’s also touted as a ‘superfood’ for its proven health benefits. Again like turmeric, it is used in our staple food like curries and meat as a taste-maker for its distinct flavour.
Science-backed research works by the world scientists have also found garlic to contain anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. They claim that the presence of a compound called ‘allicin’ or Vitamin B-4, besides preventing common colds, helps, to boost body immunity.
Some researchers also state it assists in lowering the risk of developing lung cancer. You may gulp down with water a clove of raw garlic early morning—maybe just a half-cut clove for a start. Practice moderation, start slow—maybe every alternate day.
Ginger
Ginger, again is an indispensable condiment for our curries and meat dishes. Known to have medicinal properties, ginger, turmeric, and salt have been a potent remedy for common cold and sore throat, always administered by our grandmas and moms.
It has been long since used for natural or alternative herbal remedies for various ailments. It is said to help digestion, reduce nausea and help fight the flu and common cold. Adding ginger to tea is quite popular in both Nepal and India, especially in the fall and winter months.
Modern studies, too, have shown that ginger contains anti-oxidant and potent anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties. Its antibacterial compound is said to help fight off viral activity against respiratory tract infection. Scientific studies have revealed its concentration of plant compounds such as ‘gingerol’ and ‘zingerone’, “inhibit viral replication and prevent viruses from entering host cells.”
You may consider using an extra slice of ginger to your curry, chicken or yellow dal (pulse). Besides, you can combine sliced ginger with hot water, a dash of honey, and lemon to make a flavoury healthy cocktail.
Citrus fruits
Citrus fruits are known as ‘agrumes’, which stands for “sour fruits” such as oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, lemons, limes, and pomelos (popular among Nepali women), to name a few.

Studies have come up with promising test results that the Vitamin C in citric fruits like limes, lemons, oranges, and grapefruits help immensely to strengthen our body immunity. Citrus also contains flavonoids, which include anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties for fighting viruses like colds and the flu. You may incorporate an orange a day in your daily diet, or if you like lemon, why not a hot lemon drink as an option?
Nuts
This is the time you thought about taking a nut, which is widely known for its nutritious values including a defensive mechanism against viruses. At the Institute of Food Research in Norwich, Norfolk, England, researchers revealed that naturally occurring chemicals found in the skin of almonds boost the immune system’s response to viral infections.
Dr. Giuseppina Mandalari of Institute of Food Research was quoted by ‘The Daily Telegraph’ as saying, “Almond skins are able to stimulate the immune response and thus contribute to antiviral immune defence.” The article also explained that almonds should be taken with the skins intact (without blanching in hot water). The findings were published in the Immunology Letters journal.
Besides strengthening our immunity, almonds are packed with monounsaturated ‘good’ fats and help reduce the risk of heart disease and lower the spike in LDL or bad cholesterol level. For tips, you can start off with eight to 10 whole almonds a day. My mother, aged 94, has been taking almonds every day for more than two decades.
Amala (Indian gooseberry)                   
The goodness and natural healing properties of amala have been passed down to us from generations from the days of yore. Ayurveda holds it as a ‘rasayana’ (elixir). It enjoys the role of an essential ingredient in the making of varied Ayurveda medicines (Read the full story).

A potent source of nutrients and minerals, science has backed this fruit to contain a high concentration of vitamins A and C. Surprisingly, one small berry contains as much vitamin C as approximately two oranges. Besides, it is rich in antioxidants, flavonoids, gallic acids, and tannins, which help boost our defence against diseases and cut down on the effects of free radicals in our metabolism.
Mushrooms
Mushrooms, or champignons as they are also called, are a powerhouse of micronutrients. From time immemorial, mushrooms have been used throughout Asia for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, too (Read the full story).
The use of mushrooms in Oriental herbal medicine was said to have been practised since ages. Mushrooms contain most of the essential elements that our body needs for nourishment, to safeguard us against diseases and to maintain overall good health and wellbeing.
Button mushrooms are considered a rich source of B-Vitamins like riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, iron, and Selenium. Apart from that, science-backed researches support them to contain antioxidant/anti-Inflammatory properties called ergothioneine and polyphenols, which help fortify our immune system.

With zero sugar, low in sodium and high in potassium, low in carbohydrate and high in fibre, it is packed with good sources of B-vitamins like riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, iron, and selenium. Scientists maintain a powerful antioxidant called ergothioneine in them fortifies your immune system by eradicating the unwanted free radicals.
Rich in linoleic acid that subdues the harmful effects of excess oestrogen (in females), and beta-glucans that thwart the growth of cancerous cells, mushrooms are being hailed as a possible cure for these cancers.
Yogurt
To remain healthy, we need to keep our guts in good shape. A strain of probiotics called lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, clinically proven to be found in yogurt, helps keep our guts healthy. It assists our digestive system and boosts our body’s overall immunity.
The bacteria in yogurt, also called the “good” or “helpful” bacteria, is also rich in proteins, calcium, vitamin B-2, vitamin B-12, potassium, and magnesium.  Since the elderly and people with chronic ailments like diabetes and hypertension are more susceptible to viruses, experts advise them to take yogurt regularly to keep their bowels free from inflammatory diseases and infections.
Herbs
Time and again, science has backed the medicinal properties of tulasi. Also called the holy basil (Ocimum Sanctum), tulasi is a common plant grown in most households in Nepal and India for its sacred place in the Hindu religion. It is believed a few drops of tulasi water added in food can purify and kill germs. If taken with hot water or as tulasi tea, it is said to work wonders against cough, cold and fever.
Scientists maintain that phytochemicals, bio-flavonoids and anti-oxidants compounds found in tulasi, such as the Rosmarinus acid helps to ward off fever and attacks by germicidal, fungicidal, bacterial and viral respiratory infection. Other herbs like thyme and oregano are also considered effective against viral infections.
Black pepper
A peer-reviewed research paper published in a medical journal submitted by Rafiq A Rather and Madhulika Bhagaty elucidated, “Piperine is an active alkaloid with an excellent spectrum of therapeutic activities such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-asthmatic, anti-convulsion, anti-mutagenic, anti-micro-bacterial, anti-amoebic, and anti-cancer activities.”

Ayurveda maintains that the substance called piperine in black pepper and its essential oil helps cure disorders and maladies such as the respiratory infection, common fever, rheumatism, arthritis and cuts down the risks of cancer.
Water
Given that our body is constituted of two-thirds of water (Read the story), our body cells need a perennial supply of water or fluids to keep them functional. It is not only the athletes or those who do rigorous workouts, or for that matter, persons involved in heavy manual work tend to get dehydrated–anyone can.

“In fact, some fruits and vegetables are more than 90 per cent water — including cantaloupe, strawberries, watermelon, cucumber, celery, lettuce, leafy greens, zucchini, tomatoes, and bell peppers,” says Johanna Sakimura, a registered dietician based in New York metro area.
But you still need water to meet your body’s full requirement. Drink one-and-half to two litres of water each day and beat dehydration to the punch!
Veggies   
All vegetables including the leafy greens and the cruciferous are a good source of vitamins and minerals that keep us strong against diseases. They are by far Nature’s nutritious best (Read the story). Rich in a host of essential nutrients such as lutein, zeaxanthin, magnesium, folic acids, natural fibre, and beta-carotene, green vegetables including the dark leafy ones are worth their weight in gold.
All vegetables, inarguably, help build our immune system strong. Following the outbreak of Covid-19, broccoli seems to have run short in the supermarkets in Europe and America much the same as the ubiquitous tissue paper and hand sanitiser.
Dal-bhat

“Our traditional Nepali staple dal-bhat is no less wholesome than any other food in the world, enjoy eating it. Just give it a little tweak to add a little more variety, a shift to nutrient-dense vegetables,” says Dixya Bhattarai, a registered dietitian and nutritionist, based in Dallas, Texas, USA (read the interview).

 
Care, measure and moderation should always be practised when a new food item is incorporated in your diet plan. If you have underlying ailments like diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, it is wise to take your doctor’s advice.
Carefully observe the directives issued by the WHO regarding the safety measures and stick like glue to them. Nothing can be less sacrosanct at this hour of crisis. Stay safe, eat right and keep fit.

The Supreme Court has issued an interim order to the government, telling it to repatriate Nepalis facing hardship in meeting their basic needs abroad in the wake of the global coronavirus crisis.
A division bench of justices Deepak Kumar Karki and Manoj Kumar Sharma issued the order on Tuesday in response to the writ petition filed by advocates Mira Khadka Basnet and Manish Kumar Shrestha among others.
The court, however, has cautioned that all the Nepalis being repatriated this way should be quarantined for a certain period to protect the citizens from the coronavirus outbreak.
If repatriating them is not possible immediately, the government should make sure that they get basic facilities for food, shelter, and healthcare wherever they are, according to the court. It has told the government to take diplomatic initiatives to let Nepalis stranded abroad renew their visas if they have been expired in this hard time."

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has claimed that he was not informed anything about a controversial medical equipment purchase deal that the government signed with a private company to import the tools required for the government’s Covid-19 response.
After the media and the public claimed that the deal involved irregularities as the supplier was selected without any free competition and the rates of the purchase were higher than quoted in the proposal, the government has already annulled the deal.
Speaking in the ruling Nepal Communist Party’s secretariat meeting at his official residence in Baluwatar on Tuesday, Oli said, “Later, I learned that the agreement was signed at the director general-level. I did not know anything about it.”
During the meeting, Oli had informed the party leaders about the government efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country, according to a leader who attended the meeting. Another secretariat member, Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokharel, who heads the government’s high-level committee to control the outbreak, had also supported Oli.
Earlier, it was expected that the party leadership would draw criticism from other leaders of the party about the controversial deal and the decision to assign the Nepal Army for the purchase after scrapping the deal. However, sources have not revealed if anyone spoke against the decisions."

The government of Nepal has decided to continue with the suspension of international flights until April 30 in its bid to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
Earlier, the suspension was said to be effective until April 15 only.
A meeting of the high-level committee formed to control the coronavirus outbreak made the decision on Tuesday afternoon, according to Narayan Bidari, a secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister.
Despite the suspension, the government will continue to let foreign governments charter flights for evacuating their citizens currently stranded in Nepal. Such chartered aircraft can take off the Kathmandu airport with the passengers but have to return empty.
Likewise, cargo flights will also continue. In particular, the government and some private businesses have also been mobilising the Nepal Airlines Corporation aircraft to fetch various medical equipment necessary for the country’s Covid-19 response from China.
Bidari says the government is yet to decide whether to extend the suspension of domestic flights also. With the announcement of the lockdown, all the domestic flights have also been suspended till April 15.
The official says discussions are underway about the suspension of domestic flights and a decision is expected soon."

Newly appointed governor of Nepal Rastra Bank, Maha Prasad Adhikari, has taken the oath of office and secrecy from Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana on Tuesday.
He also assumed his office at the central office of the central bank in Baluwatar of Kathmandu today itself.
A Cabinet meeting held on Monday had appointed him to the position which was vacant for the past three weeks since the retirement of Chiranjibi Nepal.
Assuming his office, Adhikari addressed the NRB officials stating he had expected their support to lead the regulatory bank. “I am not alone hence I am comfortable.”
In particular, he requested the bank’s deputy governor Chinta Mani Siwakoti to support as he was also one of the three candidates that Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada had recommended for the powerful position."

A man from the Saptari district of southeastern Nepal is found to have lied to the officers of Lalitpur district in Kathmandu that his mother died back home recently.
Shubha Narayan Chaudhary from Maholiya, Surunga municipality-6 of Saptadi, was currently residing in Pulchok of Lalitpur. After the government announcement to go on lockdowon to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country, he wanted to go home. However, there were not any vehicles available.
Later, Chaudhary learned that the District Administration Office issues a permit to let the vehicles ply even during the lockdown if the users have emergency reasons to travel. He desperately wanted to go home, hence told the officers that his mother died in Saptari and had to go back immediately.
However, the police were not convinced. Lalitpur Metropolitan Police Range chief SSP Tek Prasad Rai says Chaudhary said he also wanted to take 30 people along with him by hiring a bus. “We then asked him to provide us contact numbers of other family members. Then, the way he spoke changed, ” Rai says.
Police immediately arrested Chaudhary and two others accompanying him for further investigation."

Citing that the risk of coronavirus infection has increased in the country, the government on Tuesday decided to postpone the final exams of grade 11 and 12 indefinitely.
The National Examination Board says its board meeting held on Tuesday decided to postpone the exams till the next notice. The grade 12 exams were scheduled to begin on April 20 whereas the grade 11 exams were scheduled to begin on May 3.
The board says its provincial offices have been already informed about the decision, assuring the new schedules would be finalised once the situation comes under control.
The board has also instructed the students to study at home by maintaining isolation and social distancing to protect themselves from the infection.
The government had earlier postponed the grade 10 (Secondary Education Examination) also owing to the coronavirus fears. Currently, all university examinations have also been postponed, leaving thousands of students tense."

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has warned that the next two weeks can be more challenging for Nepal in terms of countering the ongoing coronavirus crisis as the country has recently entered the second stage of coronavirus infection.
In his televised address to the nation on Tuesday morning, the prime minister said the government was prepared to control the outbreak, urging the citizens to support.
“The government is fully prepared to prevent the spread of infection as much as possible and control it whenever it spreads.”
He said the government decided to conduct rapid diagnostic tests in most affected districts in order to assess the magnitude of the problem and prepare strategies to control it accordingly.
In his address, Oli also appreciated the role of local, provincial and federal level people’s representatives and government staff al all levels, health workers, and security personnel for their active participation in the government efforts to control the outbreak."

In view of the shortage of hand sanitiser in the market due to the coronavirus fears, a medicine manufacturer run by the government has begun producing and selling sanitiser.
The Nepal Aushadhi Limited says it has distributed 20,000 bottles of sanitiser produced recently as per the World Health Organisation standards.
The company’s acting general manager Bijaya Shree Bajracharya says, “We have begun marketing high-quality sanitiser to end the current market crisis.” He claims that the company staff worked hard to collect raw materials.
Informing that the company began producing sanitiser after a consultation meeting with the Ministry of Industry and the Department of Drug Administration, Bajracharya said the production would continue even after the crisis.
The sanitiser is also available for sale at its office in Babarmahal of Kathmandu."

After the government imposed the nationwide lockdown amid the outbreak of the coronavirus worldwide, all members in the Neupane family are together in their village home today; the couple’s respective offices are shut, so are the children’s colleges.
“On regular days, I, alone, do kitchen chores, but thankfully, my daughter is at home now and she is helping me out with my daily job now,” expresses Neupane, adding she, however, has complaints that her husband and her son are mostly busy with their mobile phones, television, news, and whatnot. They rarely help her in the kitchen and other cleaning works until there is an emergency, Neupane adds.
One might assume that the practice of treating household chores as ‘women’s work’ or ‘women’s sphere’ is prevalent in villages only, but city dwellers are also not much different though there are a few exceptions.  Otherwise, at this prime time of lockdown, when all the family members, male and female alike, are restricted inside the home, they should have ideally shared the chores. But this is not the case, observe gender scholars and activists.
Maintaining the status quo
Anisha Bhattarai, an anthropologist associated with Social Science Baha, observes that though the Nepali society has undergone various changes in the society, traditional gender roles are intact. “Patriarchal cultural notion that household chores fall only under the women’s domain is still prevalent dominantly in our society and unless these notions change consciously, from within the practitioners, both male, and female, there would not be any major change in the gender dynamics.”

But Bhattarai clarifies that this might not be the case when either of the couple is working from home currently. As there might be extra pressure on them for being more productive, some might be spending more time in their office work than the usual working hours at the office. In this case, even if a man is willing to learn, partake and continue their involvement in household chores, the unavailability of time obstructs him.
Gender activist Sanjog Thakuri has additional views. “The major factor that contributes to the continuation of traditional gender roles is the socialisation process. How one is groomed since their birth and what s/he observes while growing up determines how they understand and conduct their gender roles further,” he clarifies.
He exemplifies this process, “When a boy sees her mother doing all the kitchen and household works like cooking, dishes, and laundry, he also observes that her mother is only engaging and teaching his elder or younger sisters in the family about these works. He grows up with an idea that ‘this is not my work’ and acts accordingly.”
Such values would be very difficult to change even in this free time because it is rooted in their psyche very deeply since their childhood.
Rachana Upadhyaya, a researcher at the South Asia Institute of Advanced Studies, seconds Thakuri. She states, “How you perform your gender roles is determined by how one is brought up in and outside the home. These are ingrained within you.”
Bhattarai and Thakuri view that there are other possible causes of the inactive roles of the men in household chores, even in this lockdown period. Bhattarai thinks some men might not want to add extra burden to their already occupied mind. If they wish to contribute to the kitchen, they have to learn how to cook and clean the mess. Why would they bother doing so when someone is already doing so? This happens especially when they are grown thinking it is a woman’s job, Bhattarai says.
Even when they sometimes do some household jobs like arranging their beds or making tea, they rarely feel like “I am doing my job”. Instead they feel like “I am just helping either my mom or wife or sister, suggest both Thakuri and Bhattarai.

Another probable reason for this, as observed by Bhattarai, is the desire within the men to maintain the supremacy or power that they think they have over women in the patriarchal social structure.
Unlocking the barrier
But since both men and women are at home now and both have time, could not this period of lockdown be an opportunity to break these gender stereotypes?
Upadhyaya believes that a transformation into a more equitable, gender-friendly society is possible if people have a desire to do so. But then, she also clarifies that gender roles are not the issues that can be changed overnight; the change takes time. Different processes of socialisation contribute to changing the values which exist since ages ago.
Nonetheless, Thakuri feels that this can be the right opportunity to engage the children, boys in particular, in the family in household chores, make them learn, practise and continue this for a lifetime. They need to be shown that household chores are to be performed by everyone, and not only the women; they need to be taught that all the responsibilities should be shared between them equally.

But the womon like Neupane and her husband are perhaps yet to realise that. Consequently, the mother-daughter duo in the family is busy offering the two men in the family whatever they please in lunch and snack and dinner."

With the government recommending the end of the ongoing session of the Federal Parliament, President Bidya Devi Bhandari announced that both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly have been prorogued after Monday midnight.
Consequently, the session ended without fulfilling its business.
Conventionally, there are two sessions of Parliament in a year in Nepal. One session is dedicated to endorsing the government’s annual policy and programme and budget plan. Because the process takes months due to several objections of opposition parties, the session cannot look after other bills. Hence, the other session discusses many bills. Therefore, the second session is also known as the ‘bill session’.
However, in four months of this bill session, Parliament only endorsed four bills. In the first month of its business, the House of Representatives was busy electing the new speaker to fill the vacuum created by the resignation of Krishna Bahadur Mahara.
Likewise, the meetings could not be held in the last month also due to the fear of coronavirus outbreak. As the fear escalated, the government announced a nationwide lockdown, forcing the Federal Parliament Secretariat to put off meetings of both houses time and again.
The next House of Representatives meeting was scheduled to be held next week whereas the National Assembly meeting was postponed indefinitely. But with the government decision, both the meetings have been cancelled."

Maha Prasad Adhikari has been appointed the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. He will lead the country’s central bank for the next five years.
Taking over the NRB leadership will be like a homecoming for Adhikari as he spent over two decades of his career there. He had retired as the deputy governor in December 2015. As the deputy governor, he worked in close contacts with current Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada who was the NRB governor from 2010 to 2015.
When Chiranjibi Nepal was appointed the NRB governor as Khatiwada’s successor, Adhikari was also considered a strong candidate for the position. He had even made it to the top three finalists. But the Sushil Koirala-led government had picked Koirala’s financial advisor Nepal for the position.
Six months after his retirement, the government picked Adhikari for the chief executive officer of Investment Board Nepal. He is leading the board authorised to manage big development projects with foreign investments until today. His term in the IBN was due to expire this June.
Adhikari is a chartered accountant by training, but he enriched his knowledge and proved himself to be an expert in monetary economics, international finance and banking regulations during his career in the central bank. He is considered a leader in the field of banking regulations."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

It is significant as it nourishes the human body sustaining the very existence of humans. We are the result of what we eat. Not only does food define our existence, but it also shapes our physical, mental, social, and economic well-being. We must realise that the way we eat affects how the world is used.
However, with 800 million people going to bed hungry every night, the world needs a sustainable food system capable of feeding quality food to every person, every day. The prevalence of starvation and malnutrition is a critical reflection of the failure of the current food system, thus triggering food insecurity.
According to the World Food Summit (1996), the population is food secure when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Based on this definition, food security involves four pillars–availability, access, utilisation, and stability–acting as equally useful tools for food security analysis.
So, what is the situation in Nepal as far as food security is concerned?
Nepal is an agricultural country, providing a living for 65 per cent of the people through agriculture. However, it has not been self-sufficient in food for the past several years since its production growth rate is slower than its population growth rate. 
Meanwhile, the lack of interest of youth in agriculture; the use of old techniques; a lack of irrigation, fertiliser, and pesticides; and various other factors which fall under the umbrella of supply chain management can be considered some of the major factors for slow production growth in Nepal. 
While compared to the days of the 1960s when the cereal yield in Nepal was 198 per cent higher than Bangladesh and 212 per cent higher than Sri Lanka, the significant loss in production now raises questions about food security in Nepal. 
Limited livelihood and economic opportunities; frequent natural disasters and social conflicts; inadequate market connectivity due to poor infrastructure; as well as regional heterogeneity, gender, caste inequality and so on are considered the reasons for food insecurity and malnutrition in Nepal. To achieve the goals of food security, food must be available to the individuals either by domestic production, food aid, or international import. 
Moreover, the problem in the food supply chain system and management in Nepal is a disaster for both producers and consumers themselves. The supply and distribution of food are largely handled by middlemen and small groups of businesses, which has created a monopoly in pricing and transportation. Because of this, the producers do not get the actual price of their products whereas the consumer has to pay an explicitly high amount. Then, vegetables and fruits produced in various parts of Nepal fail to reach the market on time and end up rotting during transportation.
Likewise, improper warehousing and a lack of knowledge about the segregation of food in cold storage is another big issue resulting in the wastage of produced food. Thus, the lack of good governance in both domestic products and international imports has largely impacted the farmers and consumers of Nepal. 
The Government of Nepal allocates limited budgets in the agricultural sector, most of which are used to provide salaries to staff. Limited research in agriculture and a deficit in the introduction of new technology further pose a hindrance to the agricultural system and food security. Despite various NGOs and INGOs working intensely to alleviate food insecurity, the major consequences visible to everyone are the malnourished children in remote areas of Nepal. Neither the pregnant women, adolescents, and new mothers in rural areas of Nepal have easy access to nutritious food. Food insecurity has worsened as a result of the Covid pandemic due to restrictions on food production, and movement, resulting in the closure of all restaurants, factories, marketplaces, and shopping centres.
According to the Ministry of Health (2017), when comparing the prevalence of food insecurity in the mountain/hilly, and Terai regions, the mountain/hilly regions appear to have higher rates of food insecurity than the Terai region at 14 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. 
Similarly, 12 per cent of people in rural regions are severely food insecure, while 9 per cent are in urban areas. Even though Nepal has shown improvement in food security in recent years, the rough estimation suggests Nepal still imports food items like vegetables, fruits, rice, wheat, and packaged food worth $3.5 billion per year. 
The recent trend revealed that even the cities and urban areas like Kathmandu and Pokhara rely largely on Indian marketplaces for all sorts of food grains, vegetables, fruits, and other food items, thus echoing the failure of the current food security and supply chain management systems in Nepal.
Food is included among the fundamental rights in the country’s constitution. According to article 36, every citizen has a right relating to food. The Right to Food and Food Sovereignty Act, 2018, says that all  Nepalis have the right to be free of hunger. 
Similarly, The Agricultural Development Strategy (ADS), 2015-2035, places a strong priority on competitiveness, enhancing lives, access to food, and nutrition in the commercial agriculture sector of the country. The Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan (MSNP), 2018-2022, brings together the health, education, and agriculture sectors. To provide nutrition, the WASH and agriculture sectors must work together. These acts and strategies are crucial and critical in the wake of food and nutrition security.
The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) also has the potential to address this problem on both local and global levels. Many international organisations employ ICTs to map and monitor global food supplies, as well as early warning systems to respond to disasters and strengthen the food supply chain, ultimately enhancing food security. 
However, in developing countries like Nepal, the use of ICTs by farmers and rural people to combat hunger and food insecurity is still in its early stage and its full potential has yet to be realised.
Moreover, eradicating hunger and food insecurity requires the ability to engage in sincere political engagement and discourse. Pro-poor and pro-women research, extension, and capacity-building projects should be prioritised to ensure food security. 
To boost food production, distribution and access, the government must prioritise irrigated agricultural production and transportation connectivity. Higher economic development, equitable distribution, and a mix of policies such as the effective implementation of anti-poverty programmes, improved health education, and employment is required to alleviate the food insecurity problem."

Every year, May 31 is celebrated as World No Tobacco Day. This year’s theme is “Tobacco: Threat to our environment.” It indicates the impact of tobacco on the environment and people’s health. The main aim of the annual campaign of WNTD 2022 is to raise awareness among the public on the environmental impact of tobacco from its cultivation, production and distribution to waste management.
Because a significant portion of the Nepali population consumes tobacco products, it has remained an epidemic here. Hence, raising awareness about the impact of tobacco use on health and the environment is crucial in this country also. 
Cigarette smoking is the most common form of tobacco use worldwide. Other tobacco products include water pipe tobacco, various smokeless tobacco products, cigars, cigarillos, roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, bidis and kreteks. 
In recent days, e-cigarettes are also in demand. E-cigarettes are devices that heat a liquid to create an aerosol, which is then inhaled by the user. E-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, but are harmful to health and are not safe.
Over 80% of the 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide live in developing and underdeveloped countries. These countries have high death rates due to tobacco use-related illnesses.
Tobacco use continues to be a significant burden among the Nepalis as well. According to the recent STEPS Survey 2019 carried out by Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC), 28.9% of adults belonging to 15 – 69 years of age currently use tobacco in different forms including smoked or smokeless, and this accounts for 3,800,000 adults. The overall prevalence rate of tobacco use was found to be 36.8% by the NHRC in its study conducted between 2016 and 2018.
Therefore, tobacco use can be said to be an ever-prevalent epidemic in Nepal.
Breathing any amount of tobacco smoke can be harmful as there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. Moreover, tobacco use contributes to poverty by diverting household spending from basic needs such as food and shelter to tobacco. 
The tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing more than 8 million people a year, including around 1.2 million deaths from exposure to secondhand smoke. 
In the past two decades, the epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases has been highlighted due to lifestyle changes, increasing sedentary behaviour, tobacco use, unhealthy eating and harmful use of alcohol in Nepal. 
Tobacco use is considered the major risk factor for the majority of these conditions. In fact, every year in Nepal, on average, 27,137 people are killed by tobacco-caused diseases, a majority of them due to cardiovascular diseases (53%) followed by chronic respiratory diseases (21%).
Smoking can cause cancer anywhere in the body including the organs like the lungs, bladder, cervix, colon, rectum, liver, mouth, stomach, pancreas and blood. Nine out of 10 lung cancers are caused by smoking cigarettes or secondhand smoke exposure. Smokers today have a higher risk of lung cancer than in the past due to the change in how cigarettes are manufactured. Smoking not only gives physical problems but can also affect mental health as there are chances that smokers face fear, guilt, depression and more. Likewise, in infants, it causes sudden death syndrome. In pregnant women, it causes low birth weight.
Tobacco also affects the environment as much as they affect our health. Every year 3.5 hectares of land are used to grow tobacco, and it causes deforestation and soil degradation. Tobacco production requires a large amount of pesticides. For cultivation, tobacco requires a large amount of water (about 22 trillion litres) and it heavily affects the ecosystem. About 4.5 trillion cigarette butts are not discarded, creating plastic pollution. Smoking tobacco produces carbon dioxide that leads to global warming. Tobacco smoke also contributes to elevated air pollution that directly affects our environment. Likewise, 27.2 million tons of material resources are needed to make cigarettes, depleting precious fossil fuel and metal resources. 
A WHO report informs that 600 million trees are chopped down to make cigarettes, and 84 million tons of CO2 emissions are released into the air raising global temperatures. Likewise, 22 billion tons of water are used to make cigarettes. The harmful impact of the tobacco industry on the environment is vast and growing, adding unnecessary pressure to our planet’s already scarce resources and fragile ecosystem. 
Almost half of the world’s total air is polluted by tobacco smoke. Neither ventilation nor filtration, even in combination, can reduce tobacco smoke exposure indoors to levels that are considered acceptable. 
Prevention is the most cost-effective measure. Many countries around the world have already introduced laws to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places. Celebrations around the globe on World No Tobacco Day encourage more people and more countries to go smoke-free. It also includes a strong emphasis on raising the salience of tobacco use control with politicians and policymakers, and on providing analysis which will support those in government in their efforts to control tobacco. 
In Nepal, recent budget plans have started to increase taxation. Prices have increased over time, however, in real terms, tobacco has become slightly more affordable due to wage increases. Single sticks and smokeless tobacco pouches are widely available and affordable even to the lowest income groups. However, a major challenge is that government revenues from tobacco are not transparent and there is a lack of information available on the detail of tobacco taxation.
Every sector, every place, every house or every individual should know more about tobacco use, and its impact on both health and the environment. "

Of late, the risk of diabetes is increasing in Nepal also. It is projected that it will become the biggest leading cause of death in developing countries like Nepal by 2030. Therefore, you should know about risk factors around you and mitigation measures you can adopt against them. 
Health Research and Social Development Forum (HERD) has stated that in 2014, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be around 9% among adults (aged over 18). In 2012, about 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by the disease. More than 80% of diabetes deaths occur in developing countries. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates it will be one of the top 10 leading causes of death by 2030.
Nepal is a developing country with a population of about 30 million. The Nepal Diabetes Association (NDA) had reported that 15% of people, aged 20 years and older living in urban areas are affected directly or indirectly by diabetes mellitus. Among people aged 40 years and older in urban areas, this number has increased to 19%. In 2002, the percentage of diabetic patients was 19.04%, but it increased to 25.9% in 2009 in Nepal and is continuously growing ever since.
According to WHO, diabetes affects more than 500,000 people in Nepal, and this number will rise to 1,500,000 by 2030. Between 2001 and 2002, a survey conducted in Nepal showed that 6.9% and 10.2% of women suffered from diabetes and pre-diabetes respectively, in comparison to the figures for men is 10.8% and 13.2%, respectively.
Nowadays, diabetic cases are increasingly reported at hospitals in Nepal. At Bir Hospital, which is also known as the central government hospital, the seventh most common disease of medical admission was reported to be diabetes. While doing an analysis of diabetic patients admitted to medical wards of Bir Hospital over a period of four years, it revealed that the percentage of diabetic patients is gradually increasing.
According to a survey done at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), the disease comprised almost 10% of the admissions in the medical ward in 2010. Due to the reason that Bir Hospital serves more rural and deprived sections of the population, a higher percentage of diabetic patients might have been reported at the TUTH.
The percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes was found to be high up to 95%. Also, a study conducted in the eastern part of Nepal among the general population showed that 6.3% had diabetes. The reason for such an epidemical rise in the number of patients in Nepal might be an inactive lifestyle of people, obesity, an unhealthy diet — access to high-calorie processed food and sugar-sweetened beverages, and overconsumption of tobacco and alcohol.
Due to the reason that the evidence-based national guidelines, protocols and standards about the disease are not available in Nepal, it is hard to predict the condition of diabetes in the near future, as well as plan and implement different methods to control it.
According to the World Health Organization – Diabetes country profiles, 2016, the disease contributes to 3% of total deaths of all ages in Nepal. Among them, in the age group 30-69, 1270 were men and 1080 were women whereas, in the age group of 70+, 1,370 were men and 1430 were women.
People with these risk factors should be screened for diabetes at least once every three years. The fasting blood glucose levels and haemoglobin A1C level should be measured, or simply, an oral glucose tolerance test can be performed. If the test results are on the border between normal and abnormal, the screening tests are done more often, at least once a year.
The blood sugar level varies with the time of the blood glucose test done and the diabetic history of a patient. The fasting blood sugar level fluctuates from 70-99 mg/dL for non-diabetic patients whereas it goes from 80 to 130 mg/dL in diabetic patients. The postprandial (PP) or glucose level after one to two hours of meal for non-diabetic patients is less than 140 mg/dL whereas it is less than 180 mg/dL in the case of diabetic patients. 
The A1C test, also known as the haemoglobin A1C or HbA1c test is a simple blood test that measures the average blood sugar levels over the past three months. It is one of the commonly used tests. The value of A1C test for non-diabetic patients is less than 5.7%, whereas it is <7% for diabetic patients. 
There are two major types of diabetes explained below:
It is formerly referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile-onset diabetes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus usually arises in childhood and is caused by autoimmune destruction of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. Some people with type 1 of the disease have genetic variations associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, which is involved in presenting antigens to immune cells and initiating the production of antibodies that attack the body’s own cells — autoantibodies.
Formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or adult-onset diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus usually occurs after the age of 40 and becomes more common with increasing age. It is mostly asymptomatic and often diagnosed when routine measurements reveal high blood glucose concentrations or the presence of one or more symptoms associated with the long-term complications of diabetes leading to a diagnosis of type 2. Sometimes, symptoms of hyperglycemia that have been present for months or with the sudden onset of symptoms of very severe hyperglycemia and vascular collapse lead to the diagnosis of type 2. It is a result of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, as well as strongly associated with obesity.
Diabetes may also develop as a secondary condition linked to other diseases such as pancreatic disease, genetic syndromes such as myotonic dystrophy, or drugs, such as glucocorticoids.
It is a temporary condition associated with pregnancy in which blood glucose levels increase during pregnancy but usually return to normal after delivery. However, gestational diabetes is recognised as a risk for type 2 later in life.
The disease also may occur in people with excess production of growth hormone (acromegaly) and in people with certain hormone-secreting tumours. People with these risk factors should be screened at least once every three years. The fasting blood glucose levels and haemoglobin A1C level should be measured, or simply, an oral glucose tolerance test can be performed. If the test results are on the border between normal and abnormal, the screening tests are done more often, at least once a year.
Acute and life-threatening complications of the disease are hyperglycemia and acidosis (increased acidity of the blood). Similarly, there might be some other complications such as:
Attempts to prevent type 1 diabetes have been unsuccessful whereas, in people with impaired fasting glucose, progression to type 2 diabetes can be prevented by weight loss, exercise and treatment with metformin, an ACE inhibitor, or a statin.
Here are other major ways that need to be adopted to prevent and treat the disease."

On a quiet evening in Thimi, I heard a lady from the rooftop of the house yelling at her 13-year-old son. I got interested and, although against the moral conduct of a good neighbour, tried listening to the conversation.
Over a few horns of motorbikes and rumbling of trippers, I got to know the cause of her wailing at her son. It was a puppy that her son had brought home. A few moments later, I saw the boy come out of his house, and following him was the curious puppy.
That incident made me thoughtless for a moment as I myself was not able to choose any side. Then, there was this thought that the boy had done nothing wrong by bringing an innocent little puppy home.
The puppy was probably a month old; its mother had given birth to seven puppies a month ago. This morning, I could only see three of them jostling to get to their mother’s milk. The puppy had a white body with a black patch on its eyes; anyone could be excused for falling for the puppy’s cuteness.
But, the question that came to be me was ‘could I be able to adopt the dog’s family and raise them as my own in my house?’ I did not have an answer. 
The next day as I came back from my college, I looked around my neighbourhood for them but could not find them. I wondered where they were. 
Later in the evening, I saw the boy playing outside his home.
Curious about the puppies, I went to him and asked where the dogs were. He told me that his mother had carried them to the next neighbourhood and their mother followed them after eating rice and meat offered by his mother. I could know that he had an innocent sadness in his eyes when he told me that his mother no longer wanted him to be around the street dogs.
Has he committed any crime? Is there no right for street dogs and animals to live in any society? Is it bad to strengthen the social relationship with the street animals? I wondered. 
The dog’s family was very playful; the mother greeted me with a wagging tail every time I came back from college. She had been around for a few years in the neighbourhood. I had given her food plenty of times. I had a liking for her and her cute puppies. The tragedy of not being able to see them the next day kept me awake for large parts of that night.
After all, I too am a child at heart. Meanwhile, the whole neighbourhood had worshipped her just a few months back on Kukur Tihar. Decorated by the yellow garland, the white pregnant dog with her big black eyes put her tongue out and wagged her tail in the excitement of getting all the attention. How amazing would it be if the respect offered on Kukur Tihar was celebrated every day! 
My mind then wondered about these feeble animals that lived in our neighbourhoods. These animals including street dogs barked at strangers, looked at us with love, and wagged their tails when we came back to our homes. Then, their expectation of us was love and some food in return.
How often can we say they would get either of them? Ignored, hated and sometimes violated, I felt the street dogs had a terrible fate to be where they were.
Let’s once compare them to the pet dogs that lived in the same neighbourhood. There is a vast difference while treating street dogs and pet dogs.
Moreover, I am sure it is not possible to pet every street dog, but what can we do? Maybe we could start by thinking that in whatever form, these are also beautiful manifestations of nature and universal energies.
These are also the creation of the same artist that made humans. They are also a part of this big home that we call earth and that reason alone is enough for us to show respect and do what’s in our hands to help them live a better life.
I remember a statement by Brownie McGhee, saying, “Something is better than nothing.” To me, that does make sense in this scenario. I wondered if there can be a utopia. There, people would not only respect street dogs on the auspicious day of Kukur Tihar but throughout the year. It might sound impractical, but well, what if.  "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

The government has decided to extend the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak by eight days, until April 15.
A Cabinet meeting held on Monday afternoon made the decision.
When the government announced the lockdown on March 23, it was said to be effective from March 24 to 31. Later, it was extended by one week, which was going to be over tomorrow.
But the government decided to extend it again as the number of coronavirus positive cases in the country continued to increase. After three positive cases were confirmed in Sudurpaschim province on Saturday, the provincial government had also requested the central government to extend the lockdown.
The high-level committee formed to control the coronavirus outbreak had also recommended the extension.
Parliament session to end
The Cabinet also decided to recommend that President Bidya Devi Bhandari end the ongoing Federal Parliament session. Of late, the meetings of both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly had been postponed frequently due to the coronavirus outbreak fears.
Adhikari appointed NRB governor 
Meanwhile, the Cabinet meeting also picked Maha Prasad Adhikari as the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank.
Earlier today, a selection panel led by Finance Minister Maha Prasad Khatiwada had recommended three including Adhikari for the position.
The position was vacant for the past three weeks after the retirement of incumbent Chiranjibi Nepal."

The umbrella organisation of journalists working across the country, Federation of Nepali Journalists, has urged the government to ensure security to journalists who work during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak risking their health.
In a statement on Monday, the FNJ president Govinda Acharya also demanded that the government announce a package of facilities including health checkups, insurance, and purchase of communications tools for the journalists targeting the critical period.
If the ongoing lockdown has affected the living of any journalist, the government should also provide some financial support as a relief so that the journalists would feel motivated to work, according to him.
In the statement, Acharya also appealed to the media outlets not to spread fake news and rumours during the hard times."

The government has decided to extend tourist visas issued for the foreigners visiting Nepal as long as the lockdown continues without any additional charge.
Many foreign governments have already evacuated their citizens from Nepal after Kathmandu imposed the lockdown in March last week. However, many are still stranded in various parts of the country, and those whose visas have got expired are worried about the fines. Mostly, tourists of Canada, the United Kingdom, and Russia have been stranded.
The high-level committee for controlling the outbreak in the country had made a decision in this regard last week.
However, the tourists whose visas had got expired before the lockdown began have to pay the applicable fines, according to Nepal Tourism Board director Lila Baniya."

The family of a man who died in a ‘coronavirus’-special hospital in Butwal of Rupandehi district last week has not yet collected the deceased’s body, accusing the hospital of negligence in the treatment.
Baburam Thapa, 34, from Ribdikot of neighbouring Palpa district had died in the hospital on March 29 during treatment. It has already been confirmed that he was not infected with the novel coronavirus.
Following the incident, the family members and local cadres of the Nepali Congress party have been claiming that he died because of the hospital’s negligence. They have said they will not receive the body unless the government launches an independent probe into the incident and ensures compensation to the deceased’s family.
Any government authority has not responded to the demand yet."

Suspecting irregularities in a deal made between the Nepal Airlines Corporation and an agent to conduct a chartered flight from Kathmandu to Brisbane of Australia last week, Civil Aviation Minister Yogesh Bhattarai has ordered the national flag carrier not to release the due commission to the agent for now.
The Australian Embassy in Kathmandu had chartered the flight last week to evacuate the citizens of Australia and New Zealand stranded in Nepal due to the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
By carrying 274 people flying for 25 hours, the corporation earned Rs 55 million. As per the contract signed between the airline and the agent, the agent should have been provided five per of the earning as commission.
However, minister Bhattarai recently wrote to the NAC and asked why it involved the agent, Bon Travel, in the process whereas the corporation could have directly dealt with the embassy. In response, the corporation has said the embassy, not the corporation, was responsible for appointing the agent."

A selection committee formed to recommend potential candidates for the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of the country, has submitted a list of three names to the government on Monday.
The team led by Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada recommended Rajan Khanal, Maha Prasad Adhikari and Chinta Mani Siwakoti for the position. Now, the Cabinet will pick one from among them for the powerful position.
Officials in the Finance Ministry say minister Khatiwada is preparing to table the proposal of governor appointment in the Cabinet meeting scheduled for this afternoon. If Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is willing to make the decision immediately, the central bank will get its chief today itself.
Khanal is a former finance secretary. He had retired in February this year. Likewise, Adhikari, a former deputy governor of the NRB, is the current chief executive officer of the Investment Board. Siwakoti is a current deputy governor. After the retirement of incumbent Chiranjibi Nepal a few weeks ago, Siwakoti has been working as the acting governor.

The Budhanilakantha municipality office on the northern outskirts of Kathmandu has stopped a group of youth from distributing relief supplies to a settlement of Rohingya refugees in Kapan.
After the refugees lost their jobs due to the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country, a group of youth had been voluntarily providing some 60 families some foodstuffs and other daily essentials for the past few days.
However, some representatives of Budhanilakantha municipality’s ward 11 office yesterday came to the refugee camp and said no outsider would come to the site from the next day, Abdul Yas, a refugee there, laments, adding, “If the situation goes longer, I think I will not survive.”
Meanwhile, the city government’s mayor Uddhav Prasad Kharel has commented that the city stopped various groups from the relief distribution as the government requires them to go through the local government. “In the name of support, they provide a family a few kilos of rice and post their pictures on Facebook,” he says, “The assistance has become a fashion now, hence we told them not to do so.”
He claims that the UN agency for refugees has been regularly providing the daily essentials for the refugees residing there."

Dr Ramu Kharel, from Nepal, is currently based in Georgia, the US. He is busy taking care of the patients infected with coronavirus at a local hospital’s emergency ward. OnlineKhabar recently talked with Kharel about his experience of being in the front line of treating coronavirus patients, security measures required for the health workers during this time and what Nepal learn from the experiences of people like him.
Excerpts:
What are the stages a patient infected with coronavirus has to go through for treatment?
When a patient comes to our emergency department, we first measure their temperatures, then look at other symptoms followed by a series of questions. If they show relatable symptoms, they are called “persons under investigations” and we give them a surgical mask. Based on their symptoms, we categorise the patients into different categories with high, medium and minimum risks. They are kept in separate rooms and we take a nasopharyngeal swab [from their nose].
People who do not have respiratory problems and who do not have chronic diseases are sent home for quarantine and prescribed medicine against fever. Once the test results are out, we inform those patients. If the patients have to be admitted to the hospital, we treat them according to their respiratory conditions.
Across the world, thousands have died after contracting the virus. Why do you think the death toll is so high this time?
The case fatality rate of Covid-19 is 2-4 per cent anywhere. There are different factors behind this. The first is that the virus affects the respiratory system worse than other viruses, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and then death. Furthermore, it affects people with other chronic illnesses more just like other viruses and the death toll increases. Another reason is that it is easily transmitted and it is estimated that 40 to 60 percent of the world population will be infected by the virus. There is a chance that our health system will be overwhelmed by it, resulting in more deaths.
What are the differences between the treatment of Covid-19 patients and other patients?
The problem with the coronavirus is that even the healthiest-looking person can be a carrier of the virus while it heavily affects those with other chronic illnesses. It does not have any definite cure yet, and its vaccine will likely take some 18 months before we get one as per infectious disease experts. As we are still in the process of understanding the virus; new information and new protocols are coming out every day. So, it is crucial that doctors follow the security protocols on the dot as well as stay updated with the newest developments, and treat patients accordingly.
Were you involved in treatment against coronavirus-like viruses before this?
There were many other viruses similar to this coronavirus in the past, and they all cause similar symptoms like cold, cough, and fever. However, the attack on the lungs as seen in the Covid-19 patients is worse and that results in death in severe conditions. But a majority of the patients have recovered and are symptomatically treated.
Being at the frontline, how do you see the mental state of the patients in the hospital?
The emergency ward in my hospital is one of the busiest in the US. About 6,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the state (Georgia) so far, and among them, 100 are being treated in the hospital right now. Definitely, the fear of the virus has gripped people here as well. The patients are scared and there is a lot of mental stress among them. And this is true even among those who have mild symptoms.
On the other hand, how is the mental state of the doctors who are constantly treating the patients?
The doctors are also facing a high level of stress right now, with so many deaths and social turmoil around us. Doctors from cities like New York where there is a higher number of cases face a higher level of risk. They do not have personal protective equipment (PPE), or ventilators for critical patients in the hospitals. As a result, many have died. The stress in this situation is expected.
Many of my colleagues have children and also other elderly people at home. In such conditions, extra stress is added as they have to get isolated from their own family members.
What are the precautionary measures the doctors working at the frontline need to follow?
While treating the patients, those infected with and suspected of coronavirus infection both, the doctors have to follow the “universal assumption of risk”, a defensive approach, to avoid contracting the virus. If we suspect that the patients have Covid-19 based on their travel history and respiratory problems, we should use the PPE with gloves, gowns, eye gears, and a special N-95 mask. There is a protocol on how to wear and take off the PPE, as we are at high risk while taking it off. We get special training for that.
What are the procedures the doctors in quarantine need to follow?
If the doctors do not show any symptoms, they do not need to be quarantined. However, those with the virus do not necessarily show symptoms, so it is hard to tell. Therefore, they need to strictly follow the universal assumption of risk approach and PPE protocol while washing their hands regularly and avoiding interactions as much as possible. If they show any symptoms, they must isolate themselves promptly, even from the family members, and get tested for the coronavirus. A few of my colleagues have been at home in isolation.
Of late, there are reports in Nepal like doctors working at ‘coronavirus dedicated’ hospitals got mistreated in society and at homes. Is there any such case there?
Such news from Nepal makes us sad. Thankfully, to date, doctors in Atlanta are getting respect and support from society. Every night, the locals here cheer for us and the hospital administration has also been equally supportive. This is a difficult time for all of us and doctors are working continuously, putting their lives at risk. This is the time when we need support from everyone. Having said that, the doctors should not forget their duty to treat patients of all kinds and follow the protocol while doing it.
Meanwhile, the government has given guidelines to restrict our movement to essential work only, but there is not any lockdown like in Nepal. However, the state is suffering just like Nepal due to the lack of testing samples.
What are the standards to follow to keep an infected person in an ICU?
Each hospital has its own requirements for ICU placement. In general, those who have failing respiratory status, or require IV fluids or other medicines to support their blood pressure should be kept in the ICU. Even in the ICU, these patients must be isolated and the health workers must wear PPE properly while treating them.
Some hospitals have restricted the movement of doctors in and out of the ICUs by having someone deliver the medicines outside the ward and communicating via phone. They have managed iPads for the patients to communicate with their relatives.
There is a stress for contact tracing and testing as a measure to control the spread of the virus here in Nepal. Why is it important? 
The patients infected with the virus might not show symptoms until 14 days post-exposure.  However, asymptomatic patients can infect others. It has been speculated that on average, one patient can infect two to three people before they begin to have symptoms. Through contact tracing and testing, we can prevent the person from infecting hundreds of thousands of people.
Who is at a higher risk of getting infected among the health workers, ambulance workers, nurses or OPD doctors? How and why?
There are different kinds of PPEs: droplet, contact and airborne. While treating the coronavirus patients, if patients are being intubated or given treatment that includes nebulisation or BiPAP, the providers need to have airborne precautions with an N95 mask. Otherwise, droplet and contact precaution is enough. This includes a surgical mask, eye shield, gloves, and gown. If anyone is suspected of having the virus, the ambulance drivers should also use the PPE like the doctors while transporting them. In case they do not work with the patients, a simple mask is enough.
The coming two weeks can result in an increasing number of cases. For now, we have enough PPE sets for a month, but there is a chance that the virus will still overpower us. The capacity of the state and the hospital is decreasing day by day. We are asking the citizens to follow healthy habits and preventive measures, to prevent the spread of the virus.
There is a lack of PPE sets in Nepal as well. What can be the alternatives of the PPE for doctors to be secure?
Without PPE, it is difficult for providers to be safe. In case there is nothing, the least a doctor will need is an N-95 mask to cover his/her nose and mouth while treating the Covid-19 patients. Without it, they are at high risk of getting infected. But we need full sets of PPE and the health workers need to advocate for that.
Finally, do you have anything to say about the current crisis with a focus on Nepal?
The coronavirus is the biggest challenge of our generation when the health workers are the soldiers. The situation is the same worldwide and no powerful government has been able to control it. If the cases increase in Nepal, the current health system will not be able to cater to it. All the doctors, citizens and the state should understand this and be prepared for it now. To be prepared, the government and administration must focus on PPE and contact tracing and testing, while the public needs to follow public health measures like washing hands, coughing/sneezing properly, social distancing, etc."

Kathmandu, April 6
The Nepal Army has broken its silence on a recent government decision about assigning it for purchasing and supplying the medical equipment necessary for the country’s Covid-19 response.
Though the decision had triggered criticisms from multiple stakeholders including leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, the national military institution was silent for the past few days. But the army hosted a video press conference in Kathmandu on Sunday and assured the purchase and supply process would be transparent.
The army spokesperson Bigyan Dev Pandey said the institution was aware of the criticisms and concerns, stating the decision was legitimate enough as the Cabinet decided as per constitutional and legal provisions.
“If you look at the Cabinet decision, it says the Ministry of Defence, via Nepal Army, will purchase the supplies in the government-to-government model,” Pandey said, “We have already begun the procedure to purchase the goods as soon as possible in coordination with the concerned agencies.” He was of the view that the army was not alone in the process, but others would also be involved, so there would not be any possibility of irregularities.
He said the army would withdraw from the responsibility. ‘The government trusted our mechanism and handed over responsibility. We are ready to meet them.”"

The main opposition leader in Parliament, Sher Bahadur Deuba, says he consulted some former prime ministers representing various political parties on the telephone on Sunday to discuss the effectiveness of the government’s response to the coronavius crisis and immediate needs.
The former prime minister said he called Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Jhala Nath Khanal and Madhav Kumar Nepal of the ruling Nepal Communist Party; Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party; Baburam Bhattarai of the Samajwadi Party; and Khil Raj Regmi, who led the interim government formed to hold the elections in 2013.
“The leaders discussed moving forward seriously in their efforts to protect the Nepalis from the pandemic,” Deuba’s aide Bhanu Deuba said, adding they agreed to meet next soon and prepare a plan in detail.
During his telephonic meeting with the ruling party’s chairman Dahal today, Deuba assured that the main opposition, Nepali Congress, would support the government in responding to the crisis."

In the name of giving some relief to the foreign employment recruitment agents to recover the loss caused by the coronavirus crisis, the government is preparing to amend the foreign employment law that would favour the companies but could put potential migrant workers at the receiving end.
Sources say the government is preparing to remove the provision that any agency should send at least 100 workers abroad in one year to renew its licence. The provision was introduced in late 2018, arguing that the agencies sending the workers in a small number are liable to overcharge the aspiring migrant workers as they could not survive on the legitimate fees.
The agents had long been advocating for the withdrawal of the new rule.
The recent developments come at a time when the Minister for Labour and Employment Rameshwar Raya Yadav, who joined the government in November last year, is accused of working in favour of the entrepreneurs, not the workers."

The government on Sunday announced that the scheduled event of giving children Vitamin A capsules later this month has got postponed indefinitely due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
The Ministry of Health and Population informs that the second phase of this fiscal year’s National Vitamin A Programme has been postponed for now. Earlier, it was scheduled for April 18 and 19.
The ministry says it has already informed concerned agencies including the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration, and the offices of chief ministers about the postponement. The event shall take place once the situation improves.
Considering the current crisis, the ministry says it has postponed all other programmes related to the Covid-19 as there is not any sign of improvement anytime soon."

Amid widespread concerns over whether Nepal will extend the lockdown which lasts till Tuesday as of now, one of the seven provincial governments has recommended that the central government extend the lockdown.
The provincial government decided to request the federal government to extend the restriction as it is imperative for the public to save themselves from the coronavirus infection, according to the provincial Minister for Internal Affairs and Law, Prakash Shah.
The decision comes one day after three new coronavirus infection cases have been reported from the province. One of the cases is the first ‘local transmission’ case of the country and it has worried the stakeholders.
Meanwhile, the federal government is yet to make any decision about extending the lockdown. The decision was expected on Saturday, but the Cabinet meeting held yesterday could not."

Kathmandu, April 5
Alerted with the first case of local transmission of coronavirus infection in the country, the government is preparing to conduct rapid diagnostic tests of all the people who recently returned home from India.
The high-level committee formed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country is likely to take a decision in this regard today. The government will focus on the Sudurpaschim province (the far-western part of Nepal) in this process as thousands had returned home from India recently and the first case of local transmission also belongs to the province.
The government does not have any idea about the exact number of returnees, but they are expected to be more than 50,000. Most of them are out of quarantine sites set up by local governments.
The rapid diagnostic tests are not recognised by the World Health Organisation, but they help the authorities assess the severity of infection in any area, according to experts. They suggest that if the rapid test results are positive, the cases can be tested at laboratories.
The rapid tests are more important for Nepal as it has a limited number of labs and they cannot test more than a dozen cases per day, Dr Khem Karki, an expert at the Ministry of Health and Population says."

Nepal’s customs officials have said they have been unable to reopen Rasuwagadhi and Tatopani border points connected to China for trade activities owing to China’s reluctance.
China is reluctant to open the border points as the number of coronavirus infected persons is increasing in Nepal whereas China itself has significantly combatted the crisis, according to them.
Earlier around two weeks ago, Nepal had decided to reopen the border points. They were closed when the outbreak was expanding across China.
Punya Bikram Khadka, the chief of the Rasuwagadhi Customs Office, says his Chinese counterparts have said they cannot reopen the border as of now as per the Chinese policy. However, any written response has not been received yet, according to him.
Baburam Khanal, the Assistant Chief District Officer of Sindhupalchok where Tatopani point lies, also corroborates Khadka’s statement. “Our preparations have reached the final stage, but we have been informed that the Chinese side is unwilling.”"

“First, I felt I was in a state of euphoria as soon as I heard the exams got postponed. I thought that I would have sufficient time to prepare for them. I had plans to sharpen my knowledge during this leisure time utilising the available sources,” Sharma says, “But, I started regretting my childish wish as I realised this would only push my entire career back.”
Consequently, this lady in her early 20s is now much worried and fearful as there is not any sign of improvement in the situation. The authorities are clueless when the postponed exams will take place and how in these hard times. Sharma says, “I am frustrated.”
She is just one among the many students, of different levels, going through a similar emotional rollercoaster, after examinations were postponed in the eleventh hour. Experts argue that as examinations are held hostage to the authorities’ indecisiveness, the students are at the receiving end.
Shared problem
The government’s decision to postpone the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) created a lot of hullabaloo in the media. However, the SEE was not the only exam that got postponed. If one minutely calculates the numbers, the students preparing for other levels of examinations were also almost equal in number as the SEE candidates.
For example, Amnusha Chhetri wonders why her problem was ignored by the media and others. This 12th grader at Everest Innovative College in Kathmandu had achieved an impressive score last year, hence is under pressure to maintain the level this year also. But, she is not in the mood to prepare as she does not know when the exams will be held next.
Her pre-board examinations also got postponed, and she feels, “If only I could get any certainty about the board examination schedule from the concerned authorities, I would easily figure out when and how I should prepare.”
The concern is not only about academic examinations. There are many young men and women who have been preparing for the scheduled Public Service Commission examinations. Many students were taking language and scholarship tests to go abroad for further study. Today, all of them are confused.
Psychological concerns and cures
A psychosocial counsellor with a rich experience of working with students, Manita Dharel, asserts that recent postponements have left the students at the receiving end.
Dharel opines that this uncertainty about next examination schedules has led to hopelessness in the students regarding their life goals surging their mental stress levels.
“In general, most of the students in Nepal rarely take examinations with ease. They are often stressed out and worried about the questions. Their minds are occupied with mental pressure and anxiety both prior to and during examinations.” With the postponement of the examinations, their stress regarding examinations has definitely stretched out, she assumes.
Dharel says there are, of course, some students who have taken this decision very lightly while there are many others who are excessively worried about it.  “Consequently, over-thinking, increasing heartbeats, unusual sweating from palms and legs, etc. can be seen.”
As of now, almost every student is free and during this free time, students rarely can concentrate deeply on their studies. As the family and society expect more from them, such pressure and confusion are even greater in the students like Chhetri who have already achieved excellent scores, she views.
“If the students prepare for the exams from the beginning of the session, there is a better chance that they properly understand the course. It means they do not need to be worried about examinations in the last hour,” Dharel observes the mental state of many Nepali students, “However, for those students who solely prefer last-minute preparations, this uncertainty is depressing.”
Some other problems are quite peculiar. For example, Bikas Baral, an SEE candidate, complains that his parents are constantly putting pressure on him to study harder, and top the class. Even for a minute, if he switches to television or social media, he has to hear the things like, “Why are you wasting your time watching television instead of studying?” from his mother. It has left Baral restless all the time.
But, Dharel believes that the parents should try to understand their children’s mental state and emotions, their hopes and support from the family and instead of putting pressure on them to study hard every time, they need to motivate them to pay proper attention to their studies by creating a healthy, cooperative and entertaining environment.
To overcome other issues of the students and give them psychological ease, she has a long list of recommendations. “Deep breathing, practising yoga and meditation, some exercises, playing games, sharing and having a conversation and playing intellectually engaging games with the parents alongside the studies can be fruitful for the students,” suggests Dharel, “But if problematic symptoms last over 10 days, it is a must that one consults a professional.”
Turning the tables
Further, the counsellor also advises that the students can turn the table and utilise the delay in their favour. While waiting for the exams, the students need to utilise the available time wisely, studying hard, she suggests. One should think that they have got more time for preparations and act accordingly by making a daily timetable allocating time for different subjects to study, with time to spend with family and time for the social world.
The students should be able to wisely use the internet and other communications facilities not only to entertain them and communicate with others but also to gain knowledge and information useful for their study, she suggests.
Noted educationist Bidya Nath Koirala agrees with her and says the postponement of the examinations is not a big problem. Rather, the bigger problem is the way the education administrators have perceived the examination, he argues.
“Our idea of examination is that we should not let the students know the questions beforehand, we should arrange them in a conventional seating arrangement and they should be invigilated,” Koirala says, “Unless they change, postponing the exams like the situation today is sure to hamper the students’ life in many ways. Their valuable time is being wasted, there will be negative impacts on their learning attitude, and their life goals will be affected.”
Hence, Koirala suggests some policy changes are needed to avoid such problems in the future. “Maintaining regular contact between teachers and students using mobile apps and social media, taking online examinations and classes as practised by open universities and schools incorporating factual, analytical and perspective questions as per classes and levels and giving home assignments regularly should be practised by every academic institute.”
For want of any policy heading towards that, Koirala’s suggestions are not likely to be implemented anytime soon. But, it seems very likely that the students like Sharma, Chhetri and Baral could be happier if their schools really considered his advice."

Worried about the country’s entry to the ‘second stage’ of coronavirus transmission, the government on Saturday evening decided to conduct rapid tests for coronavirus infection in three districts of the country: Baglung, Kailali, and Kanchanpur.
Baglung district already has two active coronavirus positive cases whereas the threat of the outbreak in Kailali and Kanchanpur districts of far-western Nepal has loomed large as three positive cases were reported there on a single day yesterday. Another case confirmed last week also belongs to Kailali.
Only two active infection cases exist outside these three districts.
A Cabinet meeting held yesterday evening made the decision to conduct the tests, according to the government spokesperson, Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

A Cabinet meeting held yesterday evening decided to stop citizens from moving from one local unit to another and from one district to another, according to the government spokesperson, Minister for Finance Yuba Raj Khatiwada.
The government decision comes just a few hours after the country confirmed three new infected cases in a single day. Among the three cases, one is a 34-year-old woman, who happened to be the first Covid-19 patient of the country who was not recently abroad while all other cases till today belong to the people who recently returned to the country from other countries.

Kathmandu, April 4
Sixteen NGOs working for sexual and reproductive rights of the people including the right to relationship and marriage with the person they desire have urged the Nepal government to be sensitive to concerns of sexual minority groups in the ongoing crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
In a statement on  Friday, the organisations said the governments at federal, provincial and local levels should ensure that quarantine sites established in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak are friendly to gender and sexual minority groups. They also demanded that everyone, irrespective of their gender identity and sexual orientation, is protected from any kind of abuse and harassment during the crisis.
Fearing that members of such minorities group might be subjected to stigmatisation more severely during the hard times, the organisations suggested that the government should provide needful counselling services to avoid such problems.
The organisations issuing the statement include Right Here Right Now, Association of Youth NGOs in Nepal (AYON), Blue Diamond Society, Family Planning Association of Nepal, Federation of Sexual and Gender Minorities in Nepal, and Yuwalaya, among others."

The government of Nepal is waiting for a concrete decision of the Indian government to decide whether to extend the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country as the movement in India directly affects the human movement here due to the open border.
Kathmandu has imposed the lockdown till coming Tuesday, April 7, now whereas the New Delhi has already extended it one week further, to April 14.
“But this is not only a problem of Nepal,” a minister on the condition of anonymity says, “We cannot decide solely. We need to wait and see what will happen in India.”
The minister, however, clarifies that the government will make a concrete decision whether to extend it before Tuesday. Some discussions about it have begun in the Cabinet of late, according to him.
The issue has been tricky for the government as extending it could adversely affect the country’s economy and public life, but ending it could also increase threats of infection.
The government announced the lockdown for the first time on March 23 evening to be effective from March 24 to 31. It was extended by one week later. Multiple sources say the government is currently mulling over three options: end the lockdown irrespective of India’s decision, extend it as long as India extends, and partially extend it irrespective of India’s decision."

But, Sanu Maya Bolon, a BBA first semester student at King’s College in Kathmandu, was not free from the ‘burden’ of her assignments. On March 22, at  6 in the morning, she went online–with a lot of preparations and excitement. She joined a chatroom of 32 other classmates and her English Composition teacher Bhawana Shrestha for a two-hour class, online.
One day after that, the government announced a nationwide lockdown and travelling “unless emergency” was restricted. But, Sanu Maya and her classmates had their classes ‘on’, online. Their teacher, Bhawana, shares that her college was all prepared to conduct online classes if the situation demands anytime. Experiences of people like Bolon and Shrestha suggest that the lockdown, though it was not desirable, showed a glimmer of hope towards technological transformation in the Nepali education sector.
The new horizon
One week into the lockdown, many had already realised that the timeframe would be extended. As expected, the government has already added another week of lockdown. With the extension now, various private educational institutions are coming up with an alternative solution to conduct their classes online. Some departments of Tribhuvan University and Kathmandu University have also announced they are conducting online classes, during this period.
Chandi Raj Dahal, an assistant professor of media studies at KU School of Arts, has also been conducting classes online for the past week. He finds this mode helpful as teachers and students can be connected outside Kathmandu and even internationally. “While there will not be an easy alternative for face-to-face communication, this has created a great opportunity for us to start a new era of learning.”
Meanwhile, Sagun Shrestha, a Nepali PhD student at Dublin City University in Ireland, says the online classes can be effective even in Nepal as they provide students with emotional support as they get to meet their friends online, amid this lockdown.
He is currently busy researching more about online teaching-learning and says the findings so far show that the group activities are most effective to conduct online. He is also of the view that it can be very effective to push and enhance teachers, parents and learners alike to acquire digital literacy and excel.
Seconding his argument, Narottam Aryal, the president of King’s College, says, “We have only conducted a couple of demo classes, and a couple of full-fledged classes online, and we are already getting feedback from students saying that they would like to integrate online classes even after the lockdown is over and all is settled. We are already talking about the possibilities.”
With that, the changing times have changed the meaning of technology for people at homes still continuing their work. Laptops and mobile phones with a good internet connection have become more important than ever to stay connected; they are also important in teaching-learning also.
“It took me a bit of time, but there are so many tools that I was unaware of; they are all very useful and interactive, they enhance classroom activities as we [students] can comment and connect with everyone. Also, with the technology, the teachers can also easily keep track of whether the students are participating equally, and what we are doing in our space. In our online class, it is important for everyone to comment or answer, even if it’s just one line. So, it certainly keeps you on your toes,” shares Sanu Maya.
It not only keeps the students but teachers on their toes as well. Bhawana thinks the new mode of class requires more attention from the teachers, and that is good. “There are many screens for one teacher to monitor. The teacher has to make extra efforts to connect with the students and that means another dedicated time to communicate.”
Assessing the effectiveness
While online classes are not a new concept, it is new for students and teachers alike in Nepal. Though they have found this practice quite exciting now, its effectiveness is yet to be assessed.
“We are affiliated with Westcliff University, so the discussion about conducting online classes was ongoing for quite some time, and we got ample help from the university to make it effective,” informs Narottam, maintaining sufficient preparations are imperative for the effectiveness of the online classes.
Sagun agrees. He says there are two kinds of approaches one can take in any online class: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous tools allow delivery of lessons in real-time, in the form of live sessions from platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, ezTalks, Slack, Blackboard, etc. In asynchronous tools, the responses are quite delayed. The examples include learning management systems like Moodle, Canvas, etc.
Based on her experiences as both a student and a teacher, Sweta Baniya, a Nepali PhD Candidate at Purdue University in the US, says the teachers have to think about the accessibility of students before designing the curriculum. “We cannot force online education on students or parents who cannot afford a laptop or computer for their children, let alone the internet. Accessibility will be a huge issue if the students cannot download the stuff we post online.” From the US, she is currently collaborating with King’s College to conduct online classes.
New platforms of learning
The practitioners say one of the most effective, hence commonly used, platforms for online classes is Zoom, a video conferencing platform, which is more common for meetings internationally. The platform has options like conferences and webinars that can easily cater to an online class. Considering the current crisis, the platform has also announced that it would remove the 40-minute limits for its free services in March while even for the paid services, it has increased the number of participants to 100.
Another platform is Google Meet (Hangouts Meet) that can be used easily for setting up a meeting or an online class. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced free access to the platform for all educational customers until July 2020, to ease the educational growth of all worldwide. Many are already using it as a complementary tool for their classroom activities while the announcement has increased its potentialities.
There is also Moodle that is an open-source learning platform. It is customisable and used worldwide for many of the online courses as well integrated into the syllabus. This has also announced free registrations for the month of April and shows a lot of potentials for Nepali educational institutions.
Also in Nepal, telecommunication giants NTC and Ncell both have announced special packages and bonuses to make the connectivity easier and more accessible for everyone, especially for those working from home and even students.
Problems to overcome
While there are exciting possibilities, there are still problems that come along with this breakthrough.
One of the most complained aspects has been the internet connectivity. “We practised for the whole week, but on the very first day of real class, my internet was down and I could not connect with the students and they were left confused. Thankfully, we had the technical team and a stand-by teacher and the things were handled. But this does create a problem on the smooth operation, and all our preparations go in vain,” shares Bhawana.
Meanwhile, Sagun adds that one of the two dominant issues that discourage running online classes is the limited availability of technological infrastructures in academic institutions and at the homes. The second is the limited digital literacy among the stakeholders involved in the teaching-learning process.
Bhawana also fears that it might make students take the physical classroom for granted given they have the options of an online classroom.
What next? 
“Apart from conducting online classes for higher-level education, online classes are also appropriate for language classes like IELTS, GMAT, TOEFL, SAT, etc.,” says Anu Musyakhwo, a Master’s of Optometry student at Ansal University in India, based on her recent online class experience. Now back to her home in Bhaktapur due to the crisis, she is currently attending her dissertation preparation class online.
Stakeholders agree. Mahashram Sharma, a former secretary in Nepal’s Ministry of Education, says, “Now that have the opportunity and importance of IT is realised more than ever. If we are to start and go digital, this is the right time to get a head start.” Data also show that mobile penetration in Nepal has reached 130 per cent (because one person may have more than one phone number) and 62 per cent of them use the internet on their phones.
There is a prospect of connecting teachers and students outside Kathmandu as well. “However, for schools outside Kathmandu, we first have to adopt asynchronous tools to teach and impart knowledge. We have problems such as teachers not being enough, lack of infrastructural development, students walking long hours for school. We are underdeveloped and lagging behind,” says Mahashram adding, “The first step would be the integration of YouTube, TV, radios, including ‘how-to’ tutorials and video-based chapters to first get them acclimatised to handling tools, and then introduce a proper syllabus. The Curriculum Development Centre should bring up the necessary packages. However, the possibility of conducting classes for school-level education is yet to be discussed.”
On this, Sagun also suggests stakeholders, specifically primarily teachers, need to be careful in the planning stage of running online classes. “Firstly, one needs to collect some data about the possible devices the students can use to join online classes. Then, we need to work on their skills to handle digital devices to remain in such classes, and parents to create a conducive environment for the students. The schools need to be in touch with parents and their emails so that they get a chance to keep track of their children’s progress.”
He adds, “Our courses are too loaded with content or theories, and at times, their connection to the real world is missing. We should encourage teachers to make learning more applied or practical, and it might also encourage them to design their teaching that integrates digital technologies.”"

President Bidya Devi Bhandari has appealed to all citizens of the country to support the government’s efforts to control the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
In an address to the nation broadcast live on the state-owned Radio Nepal and Nepal Television on Friday evening, the president expressed her confidence that humanity would eventually defeat the virus very soon. She was of the view that people’s moderation would protect them from the virus.
In her address, the head of the state appreciated the government for the steps taken towards controlling the virus outbreak. She also praised health workers and civil servants for their hard work and dedication during the hard times. She also remarked that the government had already announced relief packages for the needy including daily wage earners.
Then, she appealed to the public and other stakeholders to abide by the restrictions imposed by the government so that they can save themselves from the infection. “Preventing this disease is easier if we all stay inside our homes by maintaining social distance,” she said.
Meanwhile, Bhandari wished for the speedy recovery of those infected with the virus. She also thanked other countries for taking care of the Nepalis affected by the crisis in the countries where they are staying now."

The government has clarified that it will not ‘rescue’ any foreigners who are stranded in any place outside Kathmandu due to the ongoing lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus infection from Friday night onwards.
Nepal Tourism Board’s Chief Executive Officer Dhananjaya Regmi says the foreign governments, however, will still continue to evacuate their citizens, who had already arrived in Kathmandu, from Nepal.
It means the tourists who are in Kathmandu can go back if their governments arrange a chartered flight, but those who are outside Kathmandu have to stay wherever they are till the lockdown ends.
In the past 10 days, the board rescued 1,708 tourists stranded outside Kathmandu and brought them to Kathmandu. In the latest case, two buses ferried dozens of tourists from Pokhara to Kathmandu."

The Ministry of Finance and other offices under it have donated about Rs 210 million to a fund the government established to take initiatives against the spread of novel coronavirus in Nepal.
According to the ministry, the offices jointly collected at least Rs 209.7 million on Thursday.
Apart from that, the other 20 banks have donated Rs 220 million for the fund.
Likewise, the Securities Board of Nepal has donated Rs 30 million. Nepal Stock Exchange has donated Rs 35.1 million, while CDS Company has donated Rs 3.5 million, informs the ministry.
Meanwhile, Rastriya Beema Company Ltd also has donated Rs 20 million, Rastriya Beema Sansthan donated Rs 10 million, and Nepal Re-Insurance Company Limited donated Rs 11.1 million for the cause.
Citizen Investment Trust has also donated Rs 20 million while Employees Provident Fund donated Rs 50 million."

Pokhara lab ‘confirms’ Nepal’s seventh coronavirus positive case, but national lab has to ‘verify’ it
Pokhara, April 3
The seventh case of coronavirus infection has been confirmed in Nepal on Friday.
The Gandaki Provincial Hospital says the report of a patient was confirmed by Pokhara Health Science Academy today.
However, the Ministry of Health and Population is yet to confirm the report. Officials say the swab samples of the case have been sent to the National Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu also as they could not completely rely on the newly established lab in Pokhara.*
The reported infected person is a resident of the Kaski district of western Nepal and had recently returned from India.
In the past two weeks, Nepal has confirmed six new coronavirus positive cases. All of the infected persons had recently returned from other countries.
The sixth case was just reported on Thursday.

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

A man has been found murdered with the use of a sharp weapon in Bharatpur of the Chitwan district on Sunday evening. 
The victim has been identified as Anil Pariyar, a resident of Bharatpur-12. His body was found near a football ground at Krishnapur, in Bharatpur-9, informs DSP Narahari Adhikari of the District Police Office.
Adhikari says he was attacked by some unidentified people. Police had taken him to the Chitwan Medical College for further treatment, but doctors declared him dead.
Police say they are looking into the case."

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support. For wireless connectivity with other devices, the phone features Bluetooth 5.2 while for charging and wired connectivity, the phone uses a USB Type-C 3.1 cable.
Google Pixel 6A features stereo speakers but does not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features two microphones.
Google Pixel 6A is launched at USD 449 and pre-orders will start from July 21 while the full retail release will be on July 28. There is no official importer or distributor of Google phones in Nepal currently, but the phone could be available from unauthorised dealers.
Should the phone arrive in Nepal, one can expect a price range from Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

The government is planning to spend Rs 9.27 billion for projects that fall under the Millennium Challenge Corporation in the fiscal year 2022-23.
According to the Ministry of Finance, it has doubled the budget for the US-funded MCC project compared to Rs 4.29 billion for the current fiscal year.
Despite continuous protest, the MCC was passed by the House of Representatives this year.
The government is spending the budget on acquiring land for road and transmission line projects.
Out of the budget set for this year, Rs 8.91 billion will be US grant and Rs 365.6 million will be spent by the government of Nepal. Most of the money for this project is spent on capital purposes."
"
The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Studying viruses is possible only in limited research centres around the world. Those who study viruses work in a laboratory with Biosafety Level 4, considering their safety. And, only a limited number of scientists in the world have access to such laboratories. Khadka hence must be feeling proud of this feat.
Amid the coronavirus outbreak going global, Onlinekhabar recently talked to Khadka about what research activities are going on around the world about the new pandemic and how should Nepal deal with it.
Excerpts:
How do you, as a virologist, view the Covid-19 pandemic?
An epidemic of this kind is something virologists worldwide had already predicted in one way or the other. However, what came as a surprise was the poor flow of information to the general public and the government bodies. Despite the abundance of useful information available to scientists, there was a delay in putting it to good use. Because of that, people worldwide are suffering during this unprecedented crisis. This epidemic is neither the first nor the last for human civilisation, so hopefully, this will teach humanity a good lesson to be fully prepared against the epidemic.
How do you assess the ongoing research about this virus against the backdrop of your engagement in research about Ebola and Zika viruses?
Our team was focused on research on antiviral drugs rather than vaccines. While vaccines protect one from the viruses, antiviral drugs cure the infection. Our greatest achievement was to be able to test millions of potential drugs at an accelerated rate. The key to success was the experience the team had in working with different viruses, testing of the same drugs in different ways. We were the first to discover that dengue targets over 100 different proteins in the body.
However, vaccines for the new viruses like the coronavirus require long-term monitoring.
What is the process for detecting a new drug against any virus, and how does it begin?
When we were working on Ebola medicine, we had years of scientific research with us and they guided us through. Regarding the Zika virus, it was a new virus, but I had the technology I had developed while working with the dengue virus. Since the Zika was a similar virus, we succeeded in researching it as well. However, the situation is different now. Other than comparing it to similar viruses, there is a dearth of actual research material related to this coronavirus. Therefore, it may take some time to fill this knowledge gap.
What were the problems in detecting the drugs for the Ebola and Zika viruses?
In the case of a new virus or an epidemic, the early days are crucial for research. When a new virus is detected, it is vital that the virus be fully available in the laboratory and that the technology is fully protected. Even if we are to use old equipment, they have to be re-authenticated for the new virus. If not, we risk infecting ourselves or transmitting others through us while conducting research. By the time I started working on the Ebola and Zika, all of these procedures had been completed. Once the process is complete, initial results may be available within a few months to a year, just as we have been able to achieve. But again, each virus is different. Therefore, the formula for the success of one does not apply to another.
Is your team also working on anti-coronavirus drugs?
Of course, I and my team are making every effort to fight the epidemic. We recently got a complete gene of the virus. However, it takes some time to produce the virus in large quantities. Initial research and security technologies are still under investigation. Our team will be able to devote more time to this research once the entire process is completed and it gets approval from a higher level.
What is the significance of genes in virus research?
Genes of a human being are made up of the DNA while the virus’ genes are made of the RNA. There are many similarities between coronavirus and the SARS. Because of this, it is named SARS-2. Now that we have coronavirus’ gene sequence, we scientists are now in a position to make this virus and to study each genetic information one-by-one in detail.
What is your take on the recent investigations on coronavirus?
Technology today has taken a huge leap. Research is being done at an incredibly fast pace, with multidimensional efforts, and new information is coming along. On the one hand, we are trying to understand the life cycle of the virus, and all aspects of its infection. While on the other hand, we are making an attempt to diagnose, treat, and control the epidemic. Both aspects are equally important, we are still trying to understand them.
How are the virologists responding to coronavirus?
As it is from the same family of the virus as the SARS and MERS, we are not surprised by the infection. However, it has amazed us as it has managed to go pandemic and instil heavy loss even if it is less dangerous than them. It poses more of a challenge for epidemiologists than virologists. Intensive research and debate on this topic will go on for years.
Is finding medicines against the coronavirus harder than finding them against the Ebola and Zika? If so, why?
It’s complicated right now, so we cannot say as it’s only been a few months since the virus was discovered. Currently, this virus is not even available for research in many laboratories. Yet a vaccine and some drugs are already under investigation at an intensity as never seen before. Normally, the process of researching any drug and vaccine is in itself a very complex task.
How long will it take to find a drug against the coronavirus?
It takes about five to 10 years for a vaccine to be fully certified through any drug research. However, if a drug that has already been used in the treatment of another disease is available, it will be ready in one to two years or less. Therefore, the initial focus is to test all the currently used drugs against the coronavirus, worldwide. If we’re lucky, maybe a drug will work. So far, that is not the case. It is equally possible to invent something soon. But, it can be estimated it will take at least five years to complete the study, given the emergency situations. For now, the best way is to avoid getting infected as there is no cure for this virus.
It is being said that the coronavirus has little effect on people with the vaccines against pneumonia or other diseases like flu. Is it true?
It is completely wrong to say so. Pneumonia is caused by a variety of factors. One of its causes is now cured by the current vaccine. However, there is no correlation between general pneumonia and pneumonia caused by the coronavirus. Therefore, such vaccines do not prevent infections or pneumonia caused by coronavirus.
A few days ago, a private pharmaceutical company announced that hydroxychloroquine sulfate would be effective against the coronavirus and would give it free of cost to the government. Has any research found this drug to be effective?
It has not been proven. On the contrary, it has been reported that people are becoming ill or have other side effects due to the use of this drug. Therefore, it is not advisable to use such medicines unless authorised by an official such as those from the World Health Organisation. Similarly, in the market today, it is widely known that some herbs can be used to treat the diseases. Such hoaxes spread with each new disease or epidemic.
Although local medicines help relieve the symptoms of fever and cough, the virus itself has not been proven to be removed and is unlikely. There is no outbreak in Nepal yet, if some people are advertising about a drug, so you can think for yourself what their motive is. Those who spread such rumours should be identified and taken action against.
When will this epidemic end? What do scientists think about this?
The virus is more likely to infect more people over time. Since the virus first came from an animal, we are not sure which other animals will be infected. Even when humans do control the disease, it is equally likely that the disease will emerge and spread in society from time to time.
Currently, Nepal lacks personal protective equipment (PPE) for the medical personnel. What can be used as an alternative to safeguard?
Nothing will be as safe as a PPE. Having said that, raincoats, waterproof pants, and rain boots can also be used as PPE. During the Ebola outbreak, Africa did not have sufficient PPE. The absence of PPE was, thus, fulfilled in the same way. Since then coronavirus is not as serious as Ebola, a tailor-made gown of polyester or waterproof material can be used.
There has been the news that the local government has made beds for quarantine and isolation to keep the infected separately. Are such wards effective?
If wards are made by the local governments without meeting any criteria, they are very risky. During an epidemic, only one person should stay in one room while living in isolation or quarantine; there is not any other option. Otherwise, if one is infected, the probability of infecting everyone else gets higher. For example, in a quarantine ward with 50 people, even if one has the coronavirus, the other 49 people will be infected even before the results come out.
There is also the need to consider whether the physicians deployed have enough PPE or not. So I would say if they do not meet the criteria, the quarantine sites readied in one day should be closed immediately. And the ICUs should also have separate criteria, and then followed thoroughly."

After the government annulled an agreement signed with a private company for purchasing and supplying various medical equipment required to test the novel coronavirus infection and treat the patients, another controversial decision about the same issue has come to the fore.
The latest revelation is that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli forced Chief Secretary Lok Darshan Regmi, who is responsible for preparing minutes of the Cabinet meetings, to tamper with the Cabinet meeting minutes assigning the Nepal Army to supply the medical equipment.
When the Department of Health Services Director General Mahendra Shrestha announced the scrapping of the agreement signed with Omni Group on Wednesday after public protests, he also told the press that the department would initiate the procurement process afresh on Thursday.
However, the department did not issue any call for proposals on Thursday. Instead, it was made public late in the evening, unofficially, that the Cabinet meeting had already decided last Sunday to assign the army to fetch and deliver the goods.
A minister who came to Onlinekhabar’s contact yesterday says the issue was not discussed in the meeting. Neither did any minister forward any proposal in this regard. So how did the decision come?
“I asked the Chief Secretary about it,” the minister says, “He told me that he added this point to the minutes as directed by the prime minister.”"

Kathmandu, April 2
Nepal has reported the sixth coronavirus positive case in the country on Thursday.
The confirmation comes five days after it had reported the fifth case. In the past week, four new coronavirus cases had been confirmed, but this is the first one for this week.
Like the second and fifth cases discovered last week, this patient had also travelled on a Qatar Airways aircraft from Doha to Kathmandu on March 19.
Speaking in a daily press briefing on Thursday afternoon, the Ministry of Health spokesperson Bikas Devkota confirmed the report. He said she was a woman from Baglung. The fifth case was also a woman from Baglung.
It has been learned that the sixth patient is 65 years old. She was in self-quarantine at her home. Now, preparations are underway to take her to a hospital.
So far, 1,184 people have been tested for the virus in the country, according to Devkota."

The Federation of Nepali Journalists has demanded that an independent investigation is launched into the removal of a news story published on Kathmandu Press, a news website of the country, on Wednesday.
On Tuesday evening, the website had published the story alleging Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s IT expert Asgar Ali, and sons of Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokharel and Oli’s chief political advisor Bishnu Rimal of forcing the government to buy various medical equipment required to control the coronavirus crisis at a rate higher than the market price.
The story was deleted from the website the next day, and the site has claimed that Oli’s political advisor Rimal and press advisor Surya Thapa directed the editorial team to remove the content. After the team refused, they made the site’s developer and designer Shiran Technologies to remove the content. Shiran Technologies is a subsidiary of F1 Soft that Ali owns.
The FNJ says the incident is an attack on press freedom.
The website republished the removed news later on Wednesday.

Hindus in Nepal and India are celebrating the annual Ram Nawami festival on Thursday. The festival marks the birth anniversary of Ram, a mythological character in the epic of Ramayana whom Hindus worship as an avatar of Lord Bishnu.
The Janakpur city in Dhanusha district of southeastern Nepal used to celebrate the festival with much fervour every year as Ram’s wife, Sita, is believed to have been born there. Thousands of pilgrims from Nepal and India used to visit the place. The city would be crowded with people from one week ago.
However, the city looked deserted today due to the lockdown and travel restrictions imposed in both countries in their bid to control the coronavirus outbreak.
The famous Janaki Temple in Janakpur has been padlocked for the past few days. However, the priest there has been giving daily worships."

Two of four active coronavirus infected people of the country have tested positive for the virus in their second tests, according to the Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu.
The 19-year-old lady from Kathmandu, who had recently returned from France, and the 32-year-old man from Dhading, who had recently returned from the United Arab Emirates, are currently undergoing treatment at the hospital.
With both the people testing positive for the second time, their stay in the hospital apparently lingers. If the second reports had come negative, the hospital could have discharged them this week.
The hospital had collected throat swab samples of both the patients on Tuesday and sent them to the National Public Health Laboratory for the test. The results were announced on Wednesday. However, their health condition is normal now.
They were confirmed as the infected on Monday and Wednesday respectively last week. They had returned home from other countries on March 17 and 19 respectively."

Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic are currently ‘skyrocketing’ across the globe, causing enormous public health havoc and a colossal economic crisis. On December 31, 2019, China alerted the World Health Organisation of several flu-like cases in Wuhan city, Hubei Province. Then, the virus got identified as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 7, 2020. The first coronavirus death was reported on January 11, and as of January 20, the spread of virus crossed China. Two cases from Thailand, one each from Japan and South Korea were early reported cases.
On January 25, the Covid-19 cases were detected in Australia and France with three cases each. By January 31, there were 9,826 infection cases from 19 countries and 213 deaths. Critically analysing the trends of spread and impact caused, the WHO then declared it a ‘public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)’. On February 11, consulting with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the WHO named the disease Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), which was previously referred as 2019-nCoV.
At this stage, there were only 395 cases and one death reported from 24 countries outside of China. But by February 28, the number of confirmed cases reached around 84,000 from 51 countries and the number of deaths climbed to 271 including 67 reported from outside China. By March 11, there were 118,000 cases and 4,291 deaths from 114 countries. With a 13-fold increase in cases within the two weeks, the WHO then declared Covid-19 as a ‘pandemic’.
The spread of Covid-19 is so accelerating that it needed 67 days from the first diagnosed case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, for days for the third 100,000 cases, three days for the fourth 100,000 cases and just extra seven days for additional 400,000 cases around the globe. A similar pattern has been seen in the mortality as it required 17 days from the first death to reach the first 100 deaths, 30 days for the 1,000 deaths, 61 days for the 5,000 deaths and 68 days for 10,000 deaths and just nine additional days for additional 20,000 deaths. In Italy alone, the cases increased 10-fold from 10,000 cases reaching more than 100,000 cases in just three weeks’ time from March 10 to 30. In a single day of March 30, around 4,000 new cases and 800 deaths were reported from Italy with a total fatality rate of around 11%. Fatality rates are varied depending on geography, age group and health conditions, specifically high (>10%) for the people elder than 70 years and the immunocompromised due to having previous infections (co-morbidities with diabetes, heart disease, etc). Currently, the United States is having the highest confirmed 188,000 cases from all states and territories. The transmission pattern there is so rampant that an 18-fold increase was achieved from March 18 to 30.
By the end of March, the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed to approximately 858,000 and 42,000 deaths from 202 countries and territories around the globe.
The impact of Covid-19 is also inevitable in the SAARC region. Despite nationwide lockdowns, there are significant increases in the number of cases in India and Pakistan. Other countries of the region are also highly affected.
In Nepal, for the past four days, there is no additional confirmed case revealed with a total of five SARS-CoV-2 positive cases at the moment out of 1,060 screened cases. The Nepal government also enforced and implemented all the measures in the right time. However, tracing suspected cases, in particular, those returning from affected countries and areas and the persons they contacted afterward, seems delayed.
The government has already set up or in the process of setting up the laboratory testing services for the Covid-19 in all provinces. If suspected cases are found positive, they should go for quarantine and supportive care for symptoms/clinical consequences immediately and even for negative cases, self-quarantine for 14 days at least is recommended.
The number of reported confirmed cases is certainly lower in Nepal as many cases have not shown any symptoms (known as ‘asymptomatic carrier’) or they are recovered or died without being diagnosed. Even when developed countries have been struggling to test floods of suspected cases, how can developing countries with a lack of capacity and infrastructure ensure proper laboratory testing in the present context?
No local confirmed cases have been detected until now, and the imported cases suggest that the virus may not have adapted to this geography and climate yet. However, there might be asymptomatic carrier cases in communities which have still potential to transmit virus to others. These types of cases need to be tracked down, identified and duly quarantined. In the present scenario, laboratory diagnosis is highly urgent to break the tip of iceberg of cases in the communities to further prevent the spread.
Laboratory diagnosis and new approach

The Covid-19 is believed to be a droplet infection, which can be transmitted via inhaling droplet with the coronavirus emitted by infected persons during sneezing or coughing and direct contact with objects that has the virus on it. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is eminently contagious strain of zoonotic origin, which is the latest of seven serotypes of coronavirus infected to humans.  The SARS-CoV-2 has a single strand RNA genome,  and genetic science has reported with 96% genetic similarity to horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus) coronavirus.
Capacity building for Covid-19 diagnosis is paramount in Nepal as there are only limited facilities such as only National Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu and BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan are able to provide viral nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) laboratory facilities. In NAAT, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the targeted gene is tested from biological samples; swab or wash from upper respiratory tract or sputum is accessed for SARS-CoV-2 confirmation. Specific genes such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N), E (envelope) genes have been utilised for screening and conformation with revealing >99% specificity across countries. However, poor sample handling, fault test kits, low viral load during early infection and viral mutation could erratically lead to false, negative results.
Besides RT-PCR, research studies from Park and colleagues from South Korea and Zhang ad team from China have already validated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test for a point of care for SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity as LAMP is simple but robust cutting-edge technology, low-cost alternative and does not need sophisticated and expensive thermocycler. It also has a potential to be the appropriate diagnostic solution of virus in resource constrain settings. Hence, the government should initiate LAMP pilot study, validate and implement in the laboratories where minimal upgrading and capacity building is needed. The LAMP technology can also be utilised in regular diagnosis of tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy and many viral diseases in rural laboratory with upgrading to BSL-2 and could also be applicable for future emerging infectious outbreaks.
In this health emergency situation, searching and engaging in experts such as molecular bio-scientists, laboratory, clinical scientists with previous knowledge and skills should receive a priority to cope in this extreme situation. The government, collaborating or bringing cutting-edge technology from China, South Korea and other countries, must urgently establish or reinvigorate the diagnostic/research laboratories equipped with molecular facility in potential government and private hospitals, research centres, and academic institutions. These facilities should properly be decentralised to test the suspected cases in their proximal periphery which restricts the mobility and control viral spillover.
Potential therapy
There is no any authentic therapy and vaccine developed against the Covid-19 so far. However, a few drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials. Anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, announced as “game-changer” by US President Donald Trump, received an emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration for coronavirus treatment/care on March 29 in spite of the limited evidence in support.
Despite varieties of side effects and serious toxicities, these drugs have also been incorporated in the interim clinical guidelines for Covid-19 treatment management in China, Belgium and South Korea as there is no choice left. Two case reports revealed anti-viral drug remdesivir was effective against Covid-19 infected critical patient in California, and a young case in Washington, the US. A combination of three drugs; two antivirals ritonavir and lopinavir  with interferon-beta, a molecule involved in regulating inflammation in the body, are also on the list of WHO global trials SOLIDARITY for potential therapeutic applications against the Covid-19.
However, no high efficacy drugs and vaccines are officially approved and available for the treatment and management of the Covid-19 patients to date. In the case of critical and terminally ill pneumonia patients of Covid-19, without any choice of therapy, monotherapy or combination therapy of these drugs might be recommended based on the clinician’s evaluation and decision though direct supervision and regular monitoring.
Unprecedented preventive actions and measures
The choice remaining at this stage, hence, is simple: prevention is better than cure. Therefore, convenient laboratory diagnosis of suspected cases, quarantining, caring and providing supportive care for confirmed cases, contact tracing and isolating in their proximity, maintaining social distancing or self-quarantine (isolation) via nationwide lockdown are eminently crucial for controlling the Covid-19 transmission. Learning from the experiences from China and South Korea, the government has taken essential measures and is committed to fighting against the Covid-19.
Maintaining personal hygiene is one of the important measures against the Covid-19. Hence, effective hand washing, disinfection with 70% alcoholic sanitiser, and spraying on potentially infected surfaces with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, which kills the virus within a minute, are also recommended. Moreover, following all pivotal measures such as reducing mental stress, boosting immunity via eating fresh fruits and food, relaxing, engaging indoor activities of your interests and exercising, keeping two-metre social distance, using masks when going outside, and wearing mandatory personal protection equipment (PPE) properly by frontline health workers in clinical settings are extremely pertinent for transmission prevention.
In addition, the government should set up additional quarantine and healthcare facilities immediately near Nepal-India borders for those who are currently entering Nepal, provide those needy individuals support packages (food and essentials) during the lockdown and properly monitor emergency preparedness and response and implement the necessary actions promptly.  Indeed, we all need to stay informed via authentic news sources (the WHO, the government, etc) and avoid fake news, rumours, and hoaxes, and deeply uphold the government commitment, measures, and strategies to conquer against this perilous pandemic.

Nowadays, the novel coronavirus is causing widespread concerns, fear, and stress among people. Such reactions should be considered natural in such an uncertain situation. It is also natural that the virus is affecting the mental health of an individual, group, society, community, nation, and the whole world as well.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may be panic and stressful for the people. Various studies and research works have concluded that being quarantined for a long period of time may result in anxiety, stress, anger, sleep disturbance, feeling of isolation, and depression. Staying indoors while maintaining social distance is the only way to control the further spread of coronavirus now. But, it is also a reality that a different person reacts differently to such situations.
Different research projects in various countries have found that psychological effects of quarantine can burst into post-traumatic stress, a feeling of isolation, anger, fear, confusion, and depression, misuse of alcohol and substances among others. It is said that those people having weaker social relationships are 50% more likely to die over a given period in comparison to those with a more healthy relationship with strong connections. Staying alone seems to be as mortal as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
That is why staying away from social connections, even for a short period, does not feel good and may result in emotional and cognitive disturbances. As much as possible, binding ourselves with the family rather than staying alone makes one happy, lively, and safe too. According to Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a psychology and neuroscience professor at Brigham Young University, “It’s this unpleasant condition that propels us to find out social connections just like hunger animate us to search for food”.
But, in this current pandemic situation, avoid face to face contact to save yourself from dangerous and direct effects. A healthy and nutritious diet should be taken to boost up the immune system to function properly with limited use of alcohol and sugar intake. Avoid smoking.
Meanwhile, most of the health care workers working in the frontline are facing stress because of long working hours, limited availability of personal protective equipment and the subsequent fear of the high risk of infection and exposure. Those health care workers may become apprehensive that they may suffer from the financial crises, and unemployment etc.
Besides, other vulnerable groups of people like pregnant women, children and elderly people with disabilities should be kept in safe places allocating only fewer visitors, but they might find it lonely. Because of stigma and discrimination, people may become panic and prone to develop anxiety in the coming days.
To cope with such problems, here are a few tips that you can implement for an effective self-care in this critical situation:
Psychological first aid
Psychosocial counselling: People should ventilate their feelings and talk, share about other issues to relieve from stress. If you feel overwhelmed, seek help for professional support early.
Here are a few other tips to further maintain physical and psychological health

Owing to widespread criticism and suspicions of apparent irregularities in a deal signed with a private company for the purchase and supply of various medical equipment for controlling the coronavirus infection and the treatment of Covid-19 patients, the government has scrapped the deal.
Mahendra Shrestha, the chief of the Department of Health Services that signed the deal, says the agreement with Omni Group has been cancelled after the company failed to supply the equipment as stated in the agreement.
However, implementing the agreement, the government has already brought various goods from China earlier this week.
Meanwhile, Shrestha also confessed that the government paid the group 20 per cent more than the price quoted by the company in its proposal. The government also blacklisted the company.

The government of Nepal has spent around Rs 1.5 billion on various activities against the coronavirus infection in the country so far.
Dhani Ram Sharma, a joint secretary in the Ministry of Finance, says the government allocated around Rs 850 million by transferring the fund allocated to the Ministry of Health. “This money will be spent on purchasing medical equipment and upgrading the hospitals,” Sharma says, “But we have not allocated any additional fund except what was approved for the Ministry of Health.”
However, the government has also allocated an additional Rs 500 million for the Coronavirus Infection Prevention, Control and Treatment Fund.
Earlier, the government had allocated Rs 130 million in evacuating Nepalis from China and quarantining them in Kharipati of Bhaktapur in February.
Officials say the government will make decisions about allocating additional funds based on how the situation develops further."

A 52-year-old woman from Dhankuta district of eastern Nepal died in Biratnagar on Tuesday for want of treatment.
She was taken to different hospitals on time, but two hospitals in the Province 1 capital city rejected her admission suspecting she was a coronavirus positive case and she might spread the infection.
A resident of Mahalaxmi municipality-5 of Dhankuta, Nara Devi Gurung, who had high blood pressure, had fallen unconscious in the early morning Tuesday. The family rushed her to BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan. The hospital said she should be admitted to an intensive care unit, for which the hospital did not have any bed, and referred her to Biratnagar-based Neuro Hospital.
The Biratnagar hospital said it did not have a ventilator available and referred her to Birat Nursing Home nearby. The second hospital in the city also rejected her admission without mentioning any reason.
Then, the family took her to Nobel Medical College in the city. The hospital declared her dead in around 1.5 hours of the admission.
The family later knew that Neuro and Birat hospitals rejected her admission as they measured her temperatures at 102 degrees and suspected that she was a Covid-19 patient, informs her daughter Laxmi. She says the Nobel College said her mother could be saved if she was taken to the hospital early.
Though Neuro Hospital administration insisted that it did not have a ventilator for her, Birat Nursing Home administration chief Padam Binadi said the admission was denied because the medical personnel in the facility did not have any personal protective equipment."

Most of the companies which were assigned to manage solid waste in Kathmandu Valley have run away during the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus infection in the country, complains the capital’s local government.
Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s acting secretary Rajeshwar Gyawali says many of the companies are not in communications with the municipal government whereas others are avoiding the responsibility on various pretexts.
According to him, the companies have complained of not finding workers to collect waste and increasing risks of infection while working with the garbage.
Around 25 companies in the valley are managing waste in the city currently by charing each household Rs 250 to Rs 300 currently.
Gyawali has warned of action against the companies. “The companies which live on the waste but fail to cooperate in the hard times will not be spared from the action.”
He claims the city government itself has been managing the waste for now. On Wednesday, 171 garbage trucks arrived at the landfill site in Sisdol, according to him."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

Bhaktapur has a unique history as far as elections are concerned. From local to federal elections, the only party–Nepal Workers’ and Peasants’ Party (NWPP)–secures victory in this ancient town. All big political players in the country hardly find their followers in Bhaktapur. Many people are surprised to see the trend, but Mayor Prajapati says this is not strange. 
Onlinekhabar recently held a conversation with Mayor Sunil Prajapati in which he shares his experience and challenges in his previous tenure along with plans for his second tenure. He also highlights why his party achieves landslide victory in every election in Bhaktapur.  
Your new tenure has just started, so how would you like to review your earlier tenure? 
In our earlier tenure, we fulfilled all the promises made to the public. The public is also very happy with us. The result clearly shows this as we received nine times more votes than the nearest rival. This certainly means we were able to satisfy the locals.
During the interviews, prior to the election, I had also publicly said that the maximum number of votes will be cast for Nepal Workers’ and Peasants’ Party (NWPP). Then, the work we did in different sectors such as health, education and waste management made the voters believe in us one more time making us victorious. Even, the committed voters of other parties believed in us and our commitment to developing the Bhaktapur municipality.
But, isn’t it surprising that the locals of Bhaktapur only have faith in your party only? Why has your party always been overshadowing other parties?
The locals trust us because we have always served the public with true hearts. The only thing that the candidates of NWPP have learnt is to serve the public with loyalty. Politics is just about serving the people; it is not a money-making profession. If somebody has to earn money, rather than join politics, they should start doing business. As we are completely devoted to serving people, they believe in us more than other existing political parties. 
If so, why does your party limit itself to Bhaktapur only? 
No, we are not limited. Some of our friends have even won the elections in the western part of the country in places such as Kalikot and Jumla. 
The candidates of other parties spend millions of money on the elections, but we are totally against it because we compete for the ideologies. Unless the public becomes ideologically aware, a faithful candidate like us will be unable to win the elections. But, we want to disperse our vision and ideologies throughout the country and for that, we have been working for awareness among the public. 
The 2015 earthquake destroyed many of the cultural sites of Bhaktapur. Could you let us know about the updates on the renovation work? 
In renovation works, we mobilised the locals. In the last tenure, altogether 124 works of renovation were completed while dozens of sites and buildings are still in the process of renovation. The reason we appointed locals for the renovation is they have skills and are well aware of the local resources that are essential for the renovation of those cultural sites. They have a strong attachment to those cultural sites so they will not compromise on maintaining their originality. We also wanted to spend the budget of the municipality on the public. Doing so would even provide an employment opportunity for the locals. This would also improve the relationship between the public and the municipality. 
So, what were the challenges in your earlier tenure?
There were many challenges in Bhaktapur. But among them, the main challenge was the scarcity of drinking water. But, recently, the water from the Melamchi river has reached Bhaktapur. Now, we have been successful to distribute the drinking water in every household and overcome the biggest challenge of Bhaktapur. 
All these five years, we put in continuous effort for the availability of drinking water, and now, finally, we made it happen. 
What are other remaining things that need to be done for Bhaktapur? 
There are still a lot of things. Some of them are parking management,  renovation of Hyakunche Durbar, Thantu Durbar and Jagannath area, excavation of Unansaya Chok and many others. For the issue of parking, we are planning to make parking areas in various new places. 
Likewise, we also haven’t been fully able to use the public land. We also want to improve the nightlife of Bhaktapur so that tourists would even love to visit Bhaktapur during nighttime as well. Locals have been demanding these things since the beginning of my tenure. We are trying our best on it but as these things need a huge amount of budget, we will start working on it after collaborating with the central and provincial governments. 
Comparatively, Bhaktapur municipality is seen as better in waste management, what are the reasons behind it?  
From the beginning, we were mainly concerned about reducing the waste that is usually produced by households. So, for that, firstly, we adopted the proper waste segregation method. Secondly, to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste, we provided training on rooftop gardening and composting to each house. Thirdly, we also distributed dustbins in every house. 
The locals made compost using the biodegradable waste and used it in their own rooftop farming or selling them to others. Likewise, we also buy non-biodegradable waste. 
People appreciate the way you have been providing education and health facilities. What can other local governments learn from you?
Loyalty is the most important thing that every municipality should consider while fulfilling its responsibilities. We have been transparent and loyal to our public since the inception of our tenure. Let the public know everything because this will restrain every possible conflict. 
Likewise, as far as possible, the other municipalities should focus on utilising their own resources including human resources. This will not only provide employment to the locals but also reduce the cost of the projects. Many things can be done in small amounts. 
So, for this new tenure, what are your plans for education and health?  
In education, we have been running various colleges, but if everything goes well and if we receive sufficient support from the government, we can also run the Khwopa University. If it doesn’t happen, we will add more colleges and new streams to it. 
In the health sector, currently, we have a 25-bed Khwopa Hospital, and soon we will make it a 100-bed.  At present, around 700 patients get treatment here. Then, we are also establishing health centres in every ward that include a doctor.  Likewise, our expert team will continuously run health camps for cancer, dental and other patients. And, the door to door nursing service will be given continuity. 
Bhaktapur is very rich in art and culture. But, with the passing of time, the challenges to save those art and culture are also emerging. So, do you have any plans to overcome those challenges? 
Yes, there are some ways we have thought for the betterment of our art and culture. We will begin with schools. We will send the cultural experts to schools to teach the students about our art and culture. This can be an effective method to pass our art and culture to a new generation. Similarly, we will teach the students to play our traditional musical instruments. We will not limit our ideas in teaching, but we will create a platform where students can compete to showcase their talent related to art and culture.  With that, we will also provide financial aid to endangered art and culture for their preservation.
Lastly, in short, could you tell us about the development that Bhaktapur will witness in the upcoming five years?   
Firstly, we will execute all the promises mentioned in our manifesto. There will be no issue with drinking water. Similarly, there will also be no problems related to sewage management. We have already started to work for a wastewater treatment plant.  In the upcoming five years, we will also fix the problem of unmanaged wires on electric poles. Those wires will be removed; the process for it has already started. We will also try to make as many traditional model houses as possible.    
So on, we will also make our youth more skilled. Classes in various languages such as Chinese, Japanese and others will be provided to them. We want our young to know at least a couple of languages. To ensure the youth’s employment, we will conduct free training on mobile repairing, vehicle repairing, plumbing and more. In the previous term as well, we provided free training in carpentry, masonry, tailoring and others.  
There will also be some changes in security and the transportation system. As soon as possible, we will form metropolitan police and install the CC cameras in all the places where it has not been installed. Regarding transportation, soon, we will stop vehicular movement in the core city area.  There are seven bridges being constructed on the south side of the municipality. The vehicles will use those bridges. Two of the bridges have already been completed. "

Vivek Bindra dreamed of going to London Business School, but because of his poor economic conditions, he could not. That did not let him deter him as he started his journey to become a public speaker.
First, he started Global Act in 2012 and, in 2019, he started what he is best known for today: Bada Business Community. Ultimately, he fulfilled his dream for today, he is sought as a guest lecturer in international business schools including his dream school in London.
Vivek Bindra is arriving in Nepal to conduct a one-day executive leadership programme on April 24 for entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs here. On the eve of that, Onlinekhabar caught up with him and discussed a few aspects of entrepreneurship and motivational speaking. 
Excerpts: 
You have visited Nepal many times now. What attracts you the most about the country? Anything you like, in particular?
I like that the [Nepali] people are very hardworking and progressive in nature. They are the most reliable, brave, and honest community and they are known for this all over the world. They are the people that make the impossible possible.
I also love travelling in the country. I have been to Pashupatinath and Boudhanath. And other places I would love to visit are Namobudhha, Budhanilakantha, Lumbini and Janaki mandir. Spiritually, I have wanted to visit the Mount Kailash landscape and spend time at the Hare Krishna temple chanting hymns and songs.
Nepal, in particular Kathmandu, has been booming in terms of startups. What are some of the best ideas you think the entrepreneurs can use to explore possibilities here? 
As entrepreneurs, if they are looking to commence a startup, they must look for a great foundation on principles rather than great ideas that people often run after. And there is just one way you can do it; identify the burning problem of the customers and solve it in a way that the customers need you.
After you have that, you have to make sure the business can profitably and sustainably grow without you in the picture. This means the business idea should have a profitable business model that can last and grow or scale up with a team that is well-organised and can work independently without your interference.
I recommend the VRIO model that guides that the business should be valuable to your customers, and is rare and not imitable while being organised. That way you can create an organic, ethical monopoly. 
Being an agriculture-based economy, the young people here are eager and trying to automate and commercialise the agricultural sector too. What kind of advice would you give to the agro entrepreneurs and where can they seek support from?
First of all, there is a need for young people to learn about the sector and the agri-based economy. فريق أتلتيكو مدريد Entrepreneurs can look into ways that can minimise the labour costs through technology, in all steps of farming from seeding to growing and harvesting. Then, you can look into a chemical-free natural farming approach as well as promote natural and zero-budget farming reducing the carbon footprint.
Another area to work on can be reducing food wastage and looking forward to setting up microprocessing units including a forward integration model in the business. For example, any farmer growing potatoes or tomatoes or fruits should be able to scale up his/her profession into a business and produce industries that produce potato chips, tomato sauce and fruit juice, respectively.
You have set up the Bada Business Community. What is the idea about and how does it help entrepreneurs? لعبة البلوت في السعودية How will the community flourish here and help young Nepali entrepreneurs here?
Whereas Facebook is for friends and family, LinkedIn is for professionals. In the same way, Twitter is for socio-political opinions. But, we felt that there is no platform for entrepreneurs. That is where the Bada Business Community comes in where entrepreneurs, new and old, can get relevant content, generate leads, work with mentors and build the network and stay up-to-date with everything. The community is full of businesspersons, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, investors, business content creators, mentors and professors. The platform helps you grow your community rapidly and generate revenue, in a short time. 
From Nepal, we already have many users who are taking advantage of the platform and the exposure as well as learning and earning on various topics of the business world. 
What do you suggest to those who are thinking of and are about taking up the challenge by starting their own new business rather than looking for a job?
If anyone is thinking of starting a business, there are always a few things that one should consider. 
First of all, the key is to build something that your customers like and not what you like. The best way to do this is by recognising the opportunity gap. Secondly, you have to make sure that you focus on just one thing and not too many things; that is how many businesses fail. Then, you have to make sure you are not outcome-oriented but focus on the process that solves consumers’ problems and always focus on a better product experience. If your skill, your passion and your market work together, the business will flourish. 
Next, you have to have a recurring revenue model. So, do not focus more on the investors, focus on the consumers instead, that is what will keep your business afloat. Target customers should be niche, so remember not everyone is or can be your customers.
If there is something that people often neglect, it is inventory management. It takes up a big chunk of your budget, so always focus on fast-moving products instead of slow or non-moving ones. 
Find ways to adapt and scale up your business, either through feedback from customers or through technological advancements. But, do not shy away from it just because you do not know the technicalities; you can learn them.
And, it all ties up together with a team that works independently yet harmoniously. 
At the same time, there must be many who do not want to run their own business or a startup. What would you say to them?
While we talk about entrepreneurs, I also want to highlight that there are intrapreneurs. Intrapreneurs are people who work in the company but do not behave like employees; those who become entrepreneurs within the organisation. 
Intrapreneurs take better responsibility, accountability and ownership and use critical thinking skills to solve the problems independently. They are not limited to their salary; they take initiative; they work beyond their set work hours. Rather than waiting for opportunities, they create them and even get extra incentives and out-of-turn promotions.
Intrapreneurs create value for themselves, which is why they are an asset to the company. They will always have a secured job, better pay and increment. uno rules 
Many motivational speakers are emerging here in Nepal too. Have you had the chance to be familiar with their content? What are your thoughts?
I want to, but I have not been able to. It is because of my nature that I do not look at the content of other motivational speakers, but at what my consumers are saying. 
But if the Nepali motivational speakers want to connect and train with me, they are most welcome. We will give them the training and the platform to conduct masterclasses. I am looking forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences with all Nepalis there."

Despite the pandemic, the company established in 2019 has published 10 books to date, including Sati, Mokshabhumi, Kara and Pararashtraka Patra which created quite a buzz among critics and general readers.
Recently, Onlinekhabar caught up with Dhakal for an interview. In the conversation, she has talked about her inspiration behind starting a book business, the challenges of the publishing industry, the trend of books in Nepal and many other things related to the industry.
Excerpts: 
Let’s begin with something personal. Earlier, you were a journalist working with some best media houses in the country. But, you suddenly switch to the publishing industry. What made you do so? 
Yes, back then, I was a journalist. As my career was going on smoothly, I had to quit it suddenly due to some health issues with my mother. Later, as time passed, I again wanted to do something. 
My family and friends all were fond of books. Almost every day, we somehow used to talk about books. Since all in my circle were avid readers, talking about books always fascinated me. Hence, the idea of starting a publishing house triggered me.  
Can you also tell me something about the first book of your publication?  
Our first book was ‘Biman Bidroha’ by Durga Subedi. The book really did very well in the market. The coverage we got from the overall media was overwhelming. Over 4,000 copies were sold in a week. The response from the readers and booksellers was beyond expectations. I was very happy and anxious at the same time. The identity given by the first book since my venture into the publishing industry is very special to me. 
How has your experience been in the publishing industry since then? 
As I was a journalist earlier, it has helped me significantly in running the business. All my writers and other concerned people in my book business are well known about me. It has helped me gain their trust.  
With that, working as a book publisher has been very productive for me. I have got an opportunity to meet a lot of brilliant minds while running the business. I believe the book industry is a very healthy industry as reading books never creates a loss for anyone. 
For me, every book is exclusive and publishing a book is like giving birth to a new life.
Like other industries, the publishing industry may also have challenges. In all these years of experience, what challenges have you found in the book industry?
Mainly, there are two challenges in the publishing industry. Firstly, it is finding out the quality book, and, secondly, the fluctuating book market. Once the book market was at its peak when books like China Harayeko Manchhe, Palpasa Cafe, and Rukmangad Katwal were released. But, after that, the book market fell down immensely. Even 2,000 copies are hardly sold. 
After Covid, as a result of inflation, prices of everything increased excessively. In this situation, books might not be the priority for many individuals. 
Similarly, we also need to increase the number of female book writers and that is also one of the challenges. There are many potential women writers and I want to work with them. But, probably due to their hefty engagement in family and professional life, they could not have been able to write the books. I have been continuously holding meetings with those potential women writers. They are responding to me well. I hope, very soon, the Nepali publishing industry will witness a good number of women book writers.  
With that, Covid has also posed a challenge to the book industry. We were compelled to shut our office for a long period. The loss we bear has not been recovered yet. 
So, what is the latest book trend in Nepal? 
It is found that most people are interested in nonfiction, history and politics. Nonfiction works have a relatively high demand. At the same time, some fiction works have also done remarkable jobs in the market. 
We, the members of the publishing industry, never know which book will be a hit or flop. But, we get suggestions from many individuals regarding the topic we should publish the book about. 
But, it is said that the readership of Nepali books is decreasing. What do you think? What could be the reasons behind it?  
Definitely, the readership of Nepali books has decreased notably. But, I think there is no research or survey that shows why. Some of the reasons could be the post-Covid market inflation, a lack of quality books and high engagement in social media.  
There was an expectation that the people would read more books during the lockdowns. The online booksellers were very happy about it. But, I don’t think things happened as expected. I also heard that many people could not focus on books due to the anxiety posed by the virus. 
The booksellers say that there is a lack of quality books. Likewise, they also say the youngsters only want to read English books. Hence, I think the publishing industry is struggling to increase the readership of Nepali books. I have a plan to do something about it but don’t want to reveal it now.  
Translation might be one of the ways through which reading culture and the publishing industry can be promoted. Have you thought about translating the books in the near future?
I already tried doing translations but, unfortunately, withdrew from the project. I haven’t seen sustainability in translation. There are many books that should be translated. But, currently, I am not in the position to work in translation as it requires extra financial and human resources. 
We have very limited human resources for translation. But later, if everything goes well, we will definitely work on it. 
Kitab Publishers has recently launched a book, Paradeshko Pasina. What is the book about? 
Paradeshko Pasina is a collaborative work of seven writers. Each of the writers has written about various areas of foreign employment. The book is edited by Yangesh, a noted journalist in Nepal. The topics in the books are related to government policy, remittance, changes created by foreign employment and others.This book is based on the latest facts and data. 
As the book is recently launched, we haven’t received much of a response but people are appreciating its cover page.  
They say “don’t judge a book by its cover.” Yet, because you already talked about it, could you let us know the process of cover designing for a book in the Nepali publishing industry? 
Firstly, we give the manuscript to the designers. They read them and design the cover.  We discuss the designs, and they get improvised several times. 
Most of our cover pages are designed by Sachin Yogal Shrestha. Almost all the time, Sachin and I work. Sometimes, finalising the book cover consumes a lot of time. However, we do not find it stressful, but we love it. "

Following this, she has been a key person in influencing the campaigns about autism in Nepal and in making autism among the 10 classified disabilities here. Talking with Onlinekhabar, Amatya shares her experiences and insights on what autism is, its status in Nepal and all things the country is yet to address. Excerpts:
What is the status of autism in Nepal? How do we see that changing in today’s scenario?
In the world, some 2 per cent of children are diagnosed with autism whereas according to the US government’s CDC, it is one in 54 children. We do not have the number, but there is a worrisome rate at which cases of autism in Nepal are being reported. 
Post-Covid, the cases have increased and now, there are four to fives cases being diagnosed a day from just one healthcare clinic in Nepal. By the end of the month, there are more than 120 cases of children being suspected and diagnosed with the autism spectrum. The undiagnosed cases are still a variable. 
But, given the increase in awareness levels among the people, the positive aspect is that the age of diagnosis among children has decreased from the earlier seven to eight years of age to one to three years. This is good because it is the ideal diagnosis time. Signs can be diagnosed in children as early as eight to nine months but they are easy to miss signs. By two years of age, a child’s regular development, reciprocal as well as social behaviour can be confirmed to be within the autistic spectrum or not.
The early diagnosis is also essential for the development of young children as their behaviour can be intercepted early with stimulation and behaviour therapy that helps the child to navigate through life. Parents and caregivers can facilitate them better as well, which will help them throughout their life. They might not be “cured” of autism but when they are given early intervention, they can be more independent and self-reliant, with minimal intervention from others.
How has the discussion around autism in Nepal changed in the past decade?
When we first started the ACNS, some 14 years ago, there was no awareness or no organisation even talking about autism in Nepal. Today, the scenario has changed and people know what autism is and that it is a spectrum disorder. There are many dialogues and organisations in the field, yet there are still many lapses that need to be addressed by all the stakeholders. 
Compared to the time when my son was diagnosed, parents today have more information and places to seek help for autism in Nepal. My husband and I went to a Delhi-based autism centre to learn about it and did a three-month training. Today, the ACNS is providing the same training and a diploma course for parents too. 
Also, parents now have understood that they need to speak and let others know if they do not want to be judged by society and comfort their children. There is a network of parents in various parts of Nepal that are initiating and promoting awareness of autism in Nepal.  
What are some of the common misconceptions about autism in Nepal that people need to change?
Children within the autism spectrum indeed have cognitive differences, but that does not mean they are dumb or stupid. It is just that they have an uneven cognitive development that does not match their age; they learn differently than others. In fact, there are people with Asperger’s syndrome who have high functioning brain development. 
They are good at specific tasks where they have a fixed set of work to do, in fact, even better, more productively and honestly. And, dialogues have started around the inclusion of autistic people in the workplace. We need to give them predictability cues to help them foster better communication flow. 
Meanwhile, it is also not true that they cannot attend normal schools; my child is one example. But for that, we need more flexible schools that incorporate therapeutic sessions and have trained teachers. And regardless of their performance, parents and teachers should not put the same level of expectations of their brain functioning and academic results in school. We need to take a more individualistic approach.
What are the major problems that stakeholders working on autism in Nepal are facing?
The number one problem with autism in Nepal is the lack of skilled human resources as they need skills in multidisciplinary areas and therapy techniques. Though there are needs and opportunities, we have a more unmotivated younger generation who are unaware that they can make a career in this field. 
Having said that, those who come for autism in Nepal are harder to sustain. For our organisation itself that has invested and trained the people, the human resources are lacking because we lack funds to pay them. We are still struggling to give services to those who need help today.
Another problem is a lack of discussion among the public and the normalisation of the dialogues within families. We also lack flexible schools and trained teachers that can facilitate the children.
What about the parents and caregivers? Are there enough dialogues about autism in Nepal among them?
Not at all, we have not even started to talk about it. When a child is diagnosed with autism in Nepal, it is the mother who becomes their primary caregiver, irrespective of their background. We are also not okay with leaving the child with somebody else either. So, it is more likely that the burden is more on the mother from taking care of the child to facing the judgements and social stigmas as well as taking care of other families and their needs or even putting the child over her career.
On top of all, they are struggling with their child’s condition and come to terms with it. They are more likely to develop anxiety, depression and social exclusion from friends, families and even partners. They need as much care as the child; only then can they give better care to the child. I was lucky that rather than leaving my job, I got a supportive family who helped me in taking care of our son every step of the way. 
Recently, initiatives like Care for Carers have started dialogues around it. Our parent-child training programme has been an outlet for our stakeholders and also allows them to feel a level of empathy. But, we need a more constructive nationwide system.
What else is there that Nepal can do for autistic children?
Catering to 100 per cent of children and curing them is an unrealistic dream. Yet, we can curate a plan to make a separate package to cater to the different needs of people suffering from autism in Nepal. We need to design a nationwide early intervention and awareness system. Then, we need to make sure the children should be able to go to schools near them. Another major problem that has not been discussed is the number of orphaned autistic children. 
For all this, local government units can emerge as the solution to the problems. Their roles are today limited to giving documents for ID cards. But, just having the budget and power is not enough; they need to be aware and have knowledge about what the locals need."

The National Tuberculosis Control Center (NTCC) at Madhyapur Thimi came into existence in 1989 and since then has organised and overseen many nationwide programmes to detect, treat and cure tuberculosis as well as conducted various awareness programmes. Its new Director Sanjay Kumar Thakur took over the leadership role just about a month ago but has more than 25 years of experience working in the remotest parts of Nepal, from the time when the disease was shrouded in stereotypes. 
In an interview with Onlinekhbar, on the occasion of World Tuberculosis Day, Dr Thakur says there is much to do at the community level regarding the end and elimination of tuberculosis in Nepal. 
Excerpts.
What is the recent status of tuberculosis in Nepal?
If we look at the nature of tuberculosis as a disease, it has changed a lot from the past. But, its tendency has not changed much in the last few years. In the case of Nepal, we record about 69,000 new cases every year with 191 new cases every day. It has an estimated 16,000 deaths every year with 44 deaths every day.
Of the total patients suffering from tuberculosis in Nepal, 67 per cent are male and 33 per cent are female. Given the recent data, the senior citizens or the older population are seen to be more infected whereas 6.6 per cent of the infected are from the 0-14 age group with a 5 per cent increase rate in adolescents from the previous year. 
But recently, Nepal was listed as one among the top 30 high (multidrug/rifampicin-resistant) MDR/RR-TB burden countries by the World Health Organization for 2021-2025 and this is a concerning issue.
So what is your centre’s next course of action? 
We have drafted a new five-year action plan for 2021-26. It has been approved and we will soon go into implementation. The plan aligns with Nepal’s pledge to end tuberculosis by 2035 and eliminate it by 2050. 
This year’s theme of World TB Day is ‘Invest to End TB:Save Lives’ and following our action plan, we aim to build the necessary infrastructure, mobilise human resources, set up and increase access to diagnostic tools, tests and drugs. For this, we need both economical and cooperative investment from all three tiers of governments as well as the health institutions along with supporters like the WHO and Save the Children among others. The three tiers of government have given their commitment already. 
With the action plan, we also plan to increase the fund investment by 70 per cent to minimise the gaps and overlaps. The Global Fund through Save the Children is investing in the programme and we hope to better the odds. We have already moved forward with the TB-free municipality programme in 30 local units and for the next five years, we aim to reach all of them. For this, we are also shifting from the centre-to-bottom approach to the bottom-to-top approach, to strengthen the local level for the programme to be most effective.
Neary 70,000 new tuberculosis cases per year is not a small number and it is also one of the top reasons for death. Despite its seriousness, why have we not curbed the infection yet?
There are more than 100,000 active tuberculosis cases every year. There are over 5,000 DOTS centres and with the intake of regular and right drugs, the infection can be stopped from spreading within a few weeks.
But, in our recent preliminary survey, we found that only 50 per cent of the infected have enrolled themselves in the National Tuberculosis Programme. The incubation period of tuberculosis is between two to 12 weeks, during which a patient, after being symptomatic, can also transmit the infection to others. But, in Nepal, especially outside the urban areas, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the presumptive cases and problems with early identification. 
Nepal is still suffering from malnutrition which subsequently compromises people’s immunity, one of the factors in one contracting TB. Likewise, there are people who suffer from co-infection including HIV and diabetes while they continue to live in closed settings with poor ventilation.
On the one hand, people avoid early checkups and, on the other, those infected do not follow the drug therapy properly and regularly during the six to 12-month course. Then, there is another factor: the lack of prescription of a combination of drugs and the increasing drug resistance seen in the patients.
Also, access to testing is low and contract tracing is poor. Diagnostic facilities are yet to reach everywhere, only 62 out of 77 districts. Gene-Xpert tests are expensive and microscopic tests are not enough to determine the symptoms. So the infection within the community and family members have been difficult to control.
Other than that, problems arose following weak network problems where individuals were not working together. Also, when the country went into federalism, the human resources we had was redistributed and then the priority shifted. The upcoming elections will impact the programme too as they will create a gap in the leadership in the local units. But, the five-year programme will continue and be implemented after the elections. 
So does that mean that the drug for tuberculosis is not working?
No, treatment for tuberculosis is effective with one or multidrug therapy. The DSTB treatment success rate is 91 per cent with a death rate of 3.3 per cent whereas the DR TB treatment success rate is 71 per cent with a death rate of 13 per cent. 
But, drug resistance is a problem as seven per cent of cases show multidrug resistance. More than new patients, relapsed patients are more susceptible to this and there is 11 to 15 per cent of relapsed cases.
But, the problem first arises from irregular drug consumption. So, in the post-Covid scenario, we have planned more nutritional programmes. We are also giving Rs 5,000 extra allowance to those with the poorest of economic status and those affected by the pandemic, Meanwhile, we are also giving health workers additional allowance for their work in community health facilities so that they can oversee patients consuming drugs regularly.
What about the budget for R&D, human resources and programmes? 
Regarding the five-year plan, the estimated budget is Rs four billion. But, through the plan, we are trying to set up a one-door policy to get financial help from all donors and supporters. 
Regarding the research, funding is more on need-based things rather than proactive research. But, small-scale research is funded by the organisation itself. The NTCC is also holding more lab-based testing with culture and gene-based research. Other irregular research and in-depth study are held in collaboration with SAARC and other international organisations.
For the next fiscal year, the NTCC is starting a survey to further study and analyse the trends of tuberculosis in Nepal. Throughout the time, we will also be setting up biometric identification cards to get a real-time update and minimise the plurality in cases.
Overall, what can expedite Nepal’s progress to curb tuberculosis?
The NTCC is working towards ending tuberculosis in Nepal, but it is not a one-party effort. All tiers of the government, national and international health organisations, EDPs and people need to work together.
The federal system changed the much needed vertical chain of command. So, now, the local level has to be more active and take ownership, prioritise and commit to holding different programmes and allocating budget. After all, the local governments can facilitate first-hand diagnosis and treatment better. It has to initiate and ask for facilitation where needed rather than wait for external support or intervention.
Further, according to the five-year plan, we will first take DOTS centres to each municipality so that it can minimise and track family and community-based infection. Secondly, we will hold in-patient and other training and facilitate better treatment. And third, we will bring all the pending organisations into the network and facilitate them."

The government is planning to spend Rs 9.27 billion for projects that fall under the Millennium Challenge Corporation in the fiscal year 2022-23.
According to the Ministry of Finance, it has doubled the budget for the US-funded MCC project compared to Rs 4.29 billion for the current fiscal year.
Despite continuous protest, the MCC was passed by the House of Representatives this year.
The government is spending the budget on acquiring land for road and transmission line projects.
Out of the budget set for this year, Rs 8.91 billion will be US grant and Rs 365.6 million will be spent by the government of Nepal. Most of the money for this project is spent on capital purposes."
"
The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."

Hoteliers in Chitwan have expressed concerns over the fate of elephants they keep to serve tourists visiting the Chitwan National Park and surrounding forest areas as the tuskers have been deprived of food during the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
They say their current stock of the feed has run out whereas they are unable to supply more feed due to the transport restrictions. An elephant in general needs 250 kg of food every day.
“We are more concerned about these elephants than about people,” Deepak Bhattarai, the president of Regional Hotel Association in Sauraha says, “We do not know how these elephants will survive.”
The hotels in Sauraha, a town outside the national park, own around 70 elephants in total.
They have demanded that the national park allow the elephants to graze on the park during the lockdown. The park’s Chief Conservation Officer Narayan Rupakheti, however, says the park is not responsible for the elephants as they are privately owned."

Two Indian men travelled to Gaur of Rautahat district from Kathmandu, riding on bicycles, during the lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
Raj Kishore Sah and Sanjaya Sah, permanent residents of Betauna in Motihari district in Bihar of India, left Kathmandu in the wee hours of Sunday and reached Gaur, a two in Rautahat bordering Sitamarhi of Bihar, on Tuesday evening, crossing around 200 kilometres.
They used to work as fruit vendors in Kathmandu. “We used to work daily to earn a living. But we could not sell fruits after the lockdown, and we ran out of money. The shopkeeper did not give us goods on credit, so we left,” Raj Kishore says.
Police detained them for defying the lockdown order in Pathalaiya of Bara district. After they told their stories to the law enforcement personnel, they took them to Chapur of Rautahat on a truck, after which they rode the cycles again.
Meanwhile, after the police in Gaur said they could not cross the border, the duo are sad now."

The Nepali Embassy in London, the capital city of the United Kingdom, will stay open every day of the week at a time when most offices in Britain are closed due to the accelerating coronavirus pandemic.
The embassy says it is opening throughout the week to hear the problems faced by the Nepalis in the UK and in Malta due to the coronavirus outbreak, and to take necessary steps. Before this, the embassy was open from Monday to Friday only.
Deputy chief of mission at the embassy, Sarad Raj Aran, says the living quarters of most of the embassy staff are in the same building within the embassy compound and they have been working beside the five days anyway.
He adds that the embassy has issued a notice informing of the extension of the office hours out of realisation that it should be more responsible during the time of the pandemic. The embassy has urged the Nepali students at various universities in Britain to stay safe and observe calm and discipline at such time and to contact the embassy in case of emergencies, stating that some of the students are facing problems including managing food, among others.

There are concerns galore about the ongoing lockdown’s impacts on the public’s daily life. Online news portals and news bulletins of radio and TV stations in Kathmandu have published and broadcast dozens of stories about cooking gas shortage and the government response to the crisis.

But, it seems only a few, if any, people are concerned about what stray animals in Kathmandu Valley eat during such hard times.

Around 26,000 dogs are said to be living on the streets of Kathmandu, according to the Federation of Animal Welfare Nepal. The number of monkeys in the valley is not known, but there are hundreds of monkeys in Pashupati and Swayambhu areas of Kathmandu. There are some cows also.

Previously, the monkeys of Pashupati and Swayambhu areas used to find hundreds of devotees throwing various foodstuffs to them every day. So were the pigeons in Bouddhanath, Basantapur Durbar Square and other places. There used to be sufficient food for the stray dogs also.

However, with the lockdown enforced, human beings are scarce on the road and around the temples since the past week. Subsequently, the monkeys, dogs, and pigeons are starving.

For many people in Nepal, animal welfare is an elitist agenda as there are thousands of people struggling ‘like animals’ for mere hand-to-mouth existence. They think the agenda just diverts the attention, as well as support, of Samaritans and other stakeholders from people to animals.

However, it is apparent that animals should also receive equal attention, support, and care because they are also parts of the society and they have human sympathies.

Realising this, a few benevolent human hearts have reached out to the animals and birds with the food. But that is apparently too little and too late.

Nepal is currently on lockdown, during which children are prone to fall more into such digital addiction. So it might be necessary for parents to monitor their children’s usage of the internet. Nonetheless, parents can surely guide their children to use the internet productively. And, a few good habits they can bestow upon their children are reading books and learning reading skills on the internet.
There are multiple national and international websites that have been providing reading materials for free or at a minimum charge. A few websites which would charge the users otherwise have announced free access to their contents since the novel coronavirus outbreak haunted the world. The contents available are ebooks, multimedia, audiobooks and so on.
Here, we have for you a list of such platforms for you to make your children engaged in productivity and developing their cognition during the lockdown.
OLE Nepal’s E-Pustakalaya
A project since 2008, E-Pustakalaya is an education-focused freely accessible digital library containing around 7,000 full-text documents, books, videos, audios and other forms of multimedia in various native languages as well as in English. With a user-friendly layout, the digital library is easy to browse.
Moreover, one of its webpage, EGR, is focused on the learning of primary level children through video and texts, while the other webpage, Bal Paathmala contains children’s books at three levels. Furthermore, its E-Paath platform provides digital learning materials according to the grades of the children and one can choose through multiple choices of subjects. The only drawback of E-Pustakalaya is that you cannot switch from one of the webpages mentioned above to another.
The E-Pustakalaya and E-Paath are products of Open Learning Exchange, an NGO that once adopted the government’s ambitious project One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) for its successful implementation.

Ministry of Education’s CDC Library
The contents of the Curriculum Development Centre’s library are more curriculum-focused and they provide textbooks, curricula, teachers’ guides, children’s resources and journals in multiple languages. Moreover, they contain videos of online classes of various subjects of multiple grades.
But the major problem with the website is its design. The website is not designed in a user-friendly manner as these contents need to be browsed through multiple clicks and some of the contents are unavailable to access. Nevertheless, the contents of the website are adequate and will be resourceful for children.
Kullabs
Kullabs provides notes, study materials, academic contents, videos and other multimedia items for middle school, high school, and college students. A project launched in 2012 by Kul Techno Lab and Research Centre, the website is a digital platform for both teachers and students. It provides free contents for learning online.
British Council’s Digital Library in Nepal
British Council’s Digital Library is not for children but for the Nepali nationals 18 years and above. Taking membership in the digital library provides you access to magazines or newspapers from across the globe and multimedia materials such as documentaries and full-length concerts. Moreover, various comics and graphic novels, ebooks, audiobooks and academic books, and online resources for learning English can be explored in the library. The membership for the library must be applied. Those who can become members now can enjoy the facilities free of charges until March 31, 2021.
International Children’s Digital Library (ICDL)

The ICDL’s childrenslibrary.org provides a large collection of children’s literature for free in multiple languages (unfortunately, not in Nepali though). The ICDL Foundation is a non-profit organisation, and the website launched in 2002 consists of 4,619 books in 59 languages.
Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg contains over 60,000 free ebooks, mostly older literary works published before 1924, for children as well as adults. With registrations required, every book in its catalogue is provided without cost to the readers. Thus, it is a great platform to download classic literature materials such as the works of William Shakespeare or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes.
Audible

Audible, a product of Amazon, contains audiobooks of various genres. The audiobooks, however, are not freely accessible. Nonetheless, as the schools are closed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, it has let streaming of children’s literature in audiobooks for free through desktop, mobile and apps without any registration or fees.
Khan Academy
Khan Academy is an America-based nonprofit organisation which provides different online courses, supplementary exercises and materials for educators on a variety of subjects for free through its websites and apps. Most of the lessons it provides are in the form of short videos on YouTube. Established by an American educator Salman Khan (not to be confused with the Bollywood actor of the same name), the website features the videos that cover a range of subjects taught in schools and all grades from kindergarten to high school. Its app, Khan Academy Kids, is designed for children aged two to six in order to develop their basic skills before admission to a school."

An ideal menstrual cycle is of 28 days, but it can also be from 27 to 30 days. Also, depending on the menstruating individual and their body or hormonal (im)balance, it might vary. A healthy menstrual cycle means the woman is capable of bearing a child. But, when one discusses a healthy menstrual cycle, dignified menstrual practices are a big part of the discussion. For every menstruating individual, dignified menstruation is important. 
However, the awareness and discussion around it are minimal. Hence, Onlinekhabar caught up with Radha Paudel, the founder of Global South Coalition for Dignified Menstruation (GSCDM) and a lead advocate for dignified menstruation practices in Nepal. 
Here, she explains key concepts you should know about dignified menstruation in 28 points:
Dignified mensuration can be defined as the state of freedom from any form of menstrual discrimination. This includes menstruators being free from stigma, taboos, abuse, and violence associated with menstruation. This needs to be ensured not just within the menstruating period but through the menstruators’ lives, from womb to tomb.
The International Day for Dignified Mensuration is observed on December 8 whereas the International Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated on May 28. As it is also related to women, International Women’s Day on March 8 is also important. Last but not the least, the period from November 25 to December 10 that is celebrated as 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is also important.
Dignified mensuration ensures the right to freedom, education, food, health, mobility, housing, dignity and access to menstrual hygiene products. It also advocates and promotes an environment where people get to live without discrimination, violence, biases, prejudices, humiliation or exclusion, despite their caste, social status, and sexual orientation. 
The dignity of the menstruators is the key concern here. Every menstruator should feel respected, and not be oppressed or humiliated in any way, at all times. While the rights given by the constitution and other laws should be ensured, moral values should also be practised in all situations, without excuse.
Demanding rights and access to menstrual hygiene and necessary products does not mean people forget their responsibility. They need to be conscious about the practice and the product they are using, how their bodies are reacting and more importantly where they dispose of it.
Dignified mensuration is crucial and should be regulated from the time of birth to death. This includes discrimination against child-bearers from conception. Dignified mensuration also strongly discourages foeticide (abortion or killing of a foetus in the mother’s womb) based on gender and the preferential (mis)treatment towards a child. 
This also includes freedom from social barriers and rules imposed on women to do or not to do social and religious activities at home and outside. Not only that, but it also looks at the regulations put on women during funeral rites and rituals while performing or otherwise.
People still lack a clear awareness regarding what dignified mensuration is and what it entails, along with all the intricate correlations it holds with all aspects of society. There is a lack of efforts from individual and government sides to be aware and make people aware of this. Consequently, Nepal also lacks guidelines, laws, rules and regulations that monitor and regulate dignified mensuration practices.
When one thinks about menstruation, it is often only related to women, which is natural. But dignified menstruation practice is not just about women by birth, but also about transmen and queer communities too. So, the preferred term in related discussions is ‘menstruators’ and not ‘females’ or ‘women’.
If you are talking about dignified mensuration, you have to ensure menstruators get the choice. This includes knowing the importance of dignified menstrual hygiene practices and the use of menstrual hygiene products. You also need to ensure access to such options and the freedom to use or not to use them.
The government and private organisations have taken to advertise and distribute sanitary napkins to girl children, but the sanitary napkins are still charged with 13 per cent VAT. However, there are a few organisations working to eliminate this and campaigns like “RatoKarMaafGar”.
The lack of education about dignified menstruation practices has given rise to many social evils in the country. One of the prominent social evils is the chhaupadi system, in which menstruators are restricted in a secluded place outside their home, devoid of basic human rights (as mentioned before). Though banned by the Supreme Court in 2005 and criminalised in 2018, it is still practised in some areas of western Nepal.
Those who are not in chhaupadi still face social taboos and exclusions from social and cultural gatherings and premises. Menstrual blood and menstruating people are deemed “impure”, which is why they are restricted from entering religious sites, puja rooms and kitchens within the houses. Some also bar them from seeing mirrors or coming in contact with men.
Because people do not talk about this properly, citing social and cultural “values”, victims of undignified menstruation practices end up getting scarred for life. Menstruators suffer from this “shame” and then either endure the pain, suffer infections rather than diagnosing them medically. They also throw pads away rampantly, on the roadside or in forests, so that no one sees them. As a result, it pollutes the environment. 
Another social evil, early or child marriage, is also a byproduct of undignified menstrual practices. As matters of menstruation are kept as a private affair and a taboo, girl children are discouraged to express their opinions and problems. This, with a lack of access and education to dignified menstruation practices, the situation also pushes them towards early or child marriage.
Most kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse based on gender are the results of a lack of education about dignified menstruation practices. The problem is just not the physical aspect of violence, but the verbal and mental abuse too. 
Due to undignified practices, menstruating women are subjected to forced or induced menopause too. Women either surgically (through oophorectomy) remove ovaries or chemically suppress ovulation. Other than health reasons, if a menstruating individual is coerced into getting menopause, that is against the dignified practices.
If anyone is found guilty of abusing, discriminating, or committing violence associated with menstruation, the law says they are liable to get a jail time of three months, Rs 3,000 or both. The provision was introduced in 2017 with an amendment to The National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 (section 168). But, this largely covers the issues of chhaupadi only.
As many girls in rural areas are devoid of access to defined menstrual hygiene products, they are discouraged to go to school. On the other hand, because of the societal taboos and girls being teased and shamed for having periods or period stains, girls prefer to skip school and stay at home. So in a year, they are more likely to lose some two months of education. As a result, they get behind their studies, their schooling is affected, and many other even drop out.
A man can help by not sticking to society-framed judgements. He can make women around him comfortable to talk about periods, period pain, gender issues and speaking out against discrimination or biases. The teasing in schools and passing comments over behaviours in personal and professional settings can be eliminated.
Dignified menstruation is not about keeping matters private, even if menstruators are suffering. Such matters need to be spoken and discussed among families and friends, despite their gender or sex. Only when you give women the environment at home, can they excel and feel confident in the outside world.
Practising dignified menstruation means breaking the stereotypes and changing the gender roles. It promotes equity and equality. It is more than just about giving them the reservation seats like deputy positions given to many women in the local units. Men should step aside and give women the opportunity because they can. 
When it comes to ensuring dignified menstruation, men cannot empower women by being leaders; rather they need to encourage and support them, endlessly. 
Many show that they are progressive, respect all genders, and understand menstruators need time-off. As a result, many have given the option for menstrual leave to women too. However, if the office and the staff working there still mistreat menstruators and judge them for bleeding, it is irrelevant. 
Pad pollution is a serious issue as on average, a menstruating individual who uses pads can dispose of about one and a half quintals of pads, in her total menstruating period. As a single pad requires at least 500 to 700 years to decay, one needs to be very conscious about it. Haphazard burning of the pads can also leave an impact on the nearest individual and then the environment.
Disposing of pads haphazardly does not just pollute the environment but also encroaches on the dignity of labour. A dignified practice must ensure that the dignity and rights of those cleaning the environment too.
Out of the 17 sustainable development goals, the issues of dignified menstruation are linked with nine of them: 1 [1.4], 2 [2.1, 2.2], 3 [3.1, 3.2, 3.7], 4 [4.1, 4.2], 5 [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5], 6 [6.1, 6.2], 8 [8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9], 12 [12.4, 12.5], and 16 [16.1, 16.2].
The government issued the Sanitary Pad Distribution and Management Procedure, 2019, and made efforts to provide free sanitary pads to school girls for free, but that was not implemented well. 
In December 2018, the MenstruAction conference was held in Kathmandu where stakeholders and advocates came together to discuss the issue. Ministry of Water Supply formed a committee to draft a policy on dignified menstruation in 2017 and organised training on it. Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen identified Dignified Menstruation Day and made efforts to eliminate menstrual huts or sheds.
An issue that affects half the population of the world is kept hush in Nepali society. Even after the leap taken into modernisation backed by education, people are not aware of talking about what dignified menstruation is. It has been too late from the public side. But, they can start now.

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on Sunday presented the annual budget plan for the next fiscal year 2022/23. 
The budget plan, which has a total size of Rs 1.793 trillion, has many ambitious programmes whereas it also repeats some unimplemented programmes from past years. Of this, 42 per cent is allocated for recurrent expenditures, 21 per cent for capital expenditures, 12.8 per cent for financing, and 24 per cent for grants to provincial and federal governments. 
As the country is heading towards provincial and federal elections, the budget statement has prioritised election activities. Likewise, the government has proposed some populist programmes hoping they would attract more votes for the ruling alliance in the next elections. 
Despite the critical economic situation, the government has targeted achieving economic growth of 8 per cent next fiscal year. Likewise, the government says inflation will be controlled within 7 per cent.
Here are key things you should know about each sectoral allocation of the budget plan.
The government says all wards across Nepal will have agriculture technicians. The government will ensure an easy supply of fertiliser and seeds to the farmers."

Kathmandu’s newly elected mayor Balen Shah has decided to broadcast all meetings of the city government‘s executive body meetings live.
Mayor Shah made the decision today as soon as he assumed his office after taking the oath of office and secrecy. 
During his election campaign also, Balen Shah had repeatedly promised to broadcast all the meetings live to promote transparency and good governance.
The executive body is scheduled to host its first meeting at 4 pm today. 
 Meanwhile, Shah has declared that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management. "
"
The government in its new budget plan for the fiscal year 2022/23 has announced major changes in tax rates imposed on various goods.
Thanks to such changes, some goods will come cheaper in the market whereas some others will turn costlier.
Here are some major goods that are bound to be more expensive once the new budget plan will be implemented from mid-July 2022. 
 
 "
"
Moreover, Shah has publicly stated that he would not accept any garland or any things to honour him unless the city government ensures better waste management.
His prioritisation seems valid as waste management has been one of the biggest concerns in the city. On May 26, locals of Bancharedanda in Nuwakot barred trucks laden with piles of garbage from entering the landfill site recently constructed for Kathmandu’s waste management. 
They told the government that they would only allow the state to dump waste in the new landfill site if their demands were met. A similar thing happened at the Sisdol landfill site, where every year locals obstruct trucks from entering the area.
This is why, there are times when the garbage is not picked up for days, leaving a bad odour throughout the city. While the government is much to blame for the issue, the lack of efforts shown by the people to tackle waste management is also a reason why the city stinks every year.
“This isn’t something that has a short-term solution,” says Nabin Maharjan, the co-founder and CEO of Blue Waste to Value, who has been working in the solid waste management sector since 1996. “If we don’t take this seriously, we will be responsible for all the diseases that waste will bring.”
Maharjan says the landfill model is not sustainable. And, he is right. Two landfills have filled up and building a new one will not change.
“We need a community-based model for waste management and need to promote recycling. If we don’t do that, we won’t be able to solve this.”
His solution to the problem is the practice of segregating waste from the source. But, before that, he believes every household in the valley should have a compost bin that would help tackle organic waste which comes out of the kitchen.
“Not segregating organic waste from other waste is where we’re missing the trick of waste management. This causes a lot of odour and if we are able to start the practice of using compost bins, half of our problem will be solved.”
A compost bin is a container into which you place organic waste to turn into compost over time. In the bin, you can put any waste that comes out from the kitchen, everything except meat products.
“You’ll kill two birds with one stone. First, you can do away with green waste that causes bad odour in the kitchen and second you’ll create fertilisers for your garden.”
These bins can be put up on terraces or balconies and hardly take up much space. There are some bins in the market that can be put in the kitchen and produce fertilisers in a day. But, these machines range from anything between Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000, so they might not be practical for all.
“If the government wanted, these could be brought for cheap, but for now, people should use normal ones,” says Maharjan urging people to segregate waste regardless of whether them having a compost bin or not.
Another issue Kathmandu deals with is plastic waste management. Plastics are everywhere. Products like milk, oil, bread, rice, lentils or any other food products all come in plastic packaging. And until we learn to recycle this, things will not change, he says.
And there is an option for this too.
“Once people use the milk, they need to start drying the packet and store it. You can do that by putting the packet upside down for a day or two until it’s completely dry and then storing it and giving it away for recycling. The same can be done for oil and other liquid products,” he says.
These then can be given away or sold to various institutions in the valley that are active in recycling. Doing this will help with the crisis a lot, claims Maharjan, who even urges people not to throw away electronic waste in their bin bags.
“It’s sad how people throw away everything. If you can use it, it’s not a waste. Many items that people throw can be used. Tetra packs can be turned into briquettes. Plastic can be turned into plastic again and the e-waste can also be reused or upcycled.”
He says if segregation is done correctly, things can be solved quickly, but he does add that the government needs to come up with new ways for people to get into it.
“An awareness campaign is necessary. People need to realise the importance of waste management because if they don’t, whatever the government does, will not matter because as clichéd as it may sound, change does start from home.”"

The government has set aside a budget of Rs 10.31 billion for the six metropolitan cities of the country for the fiscal year 2022-23.
Out of the six, Pokhara will receive the biggest amount while Biratnagar will receive the least. The budget for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur has increased while Birgunj, Biratnagar and Lalitpur will receive less than what they did last year.
The Pokhara metropolitan city, which has received the highest budget, has received a total budget of Rs 2.58 billion. The city has also been given Rs 28 million in supplementary grant and Rs 40 million in a special grant.
Similarly, Kathmandu metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 2.39 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Kathmandu has not received a budget for supplementary and special grants for the coming year.
The government has given a grant budget of Rs 1.80 billion to Bharatpur metropolitan city for the coming year, Rs 159.6 million more than last year. Bharatpur has received Rs 25 million as a supplementary grant and Rs 148 million as a special grant.
Birgunj metropolitan city has received a budget of Rs 1.44 billion. The federal government has given a supplementary grant of Rs 100 million and a special grant of Rs 60 million to Birgunj for the coming year. Lalitpur will get a budget of Rs 1.21 billion and a supplementary grant of Rs 30 million for the coming year. The city has not been given a special grant.
Finally, Biratnagar metropolitan city has been assigned a budget of Rs 1.21 billion from the federal government for the coming year. Biratnagar has not received any supplementary grant for the coming year, and has received a special grant of Rs 40 million."

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party has demanded reforms to the country’s electoral system.
A meeting of the central working committee held in Dhulikhel on Thursday demanded a change in the form of government with a directly elected prime minister and reinstatement of the king in a ceremonial role.
“In order to end corruption and instability, we need change the current form of government,” says RPP Chairman Rajendra Lingden. “I feel it is time to reform the country’s electoral system and have a fully-proportional parliament, a directly elected executive prime minister and a king as the guardian of the institution.”
He also said that the party would only choose outstanding candidates even if they were not in the party for the forthcoming federal and provincial elections."

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

A woman has died after surviving repeated acts of torture from her husband in Khairahani of the Chitwan district of western Nepal.
DSP Narahari Adhikari, the spokesperson of the District Police Office, says Gita Majhi died during treatment at the Bharatpur Hospital on Monday night. Injured in the assault, she was admitted to the hospital on Thurasay. 
Reportedly, her husband Ram Chandra had put a stick into her anus on Thursday, seriously injuring her. 
The woman was operated on, on Monday, but she died at around 11 pm, according to the hospital’s Gopal Paudel. 
Police have arrested the husband for further investigation. They are preparing to file two cases against him under murder and rape laws."

The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an inter-governmental organisation working in over 40 countries in the world, has extended its partnerships with the Energy Ministry, Nepal Electricity Authority and Kathmandu University to produce green hydrogen and ammonia for fertiliser production in the country.
The organisation signed various agreements with concerned government officials recently as the organisation’s Director-General Frank Rijsberman and Asia Regional Director Achala Abaysinghe visited Nepal from May 20 to 24.
The visit was aimed at strengthening existing relationships in the country and establishing new partnerships, the organisation says. 
In particular, the GGGI Nepal office says it signed memorandums with the Nepal Electricity Authority, Ministry of Energy, and the Kathmandu University to work together on green hydrogen and ammonia production for fertilisers in Nepal. 
Likewise, the GGGI launched a National Roadmap for Bamboo Sector in partnership with the Ministry of Forests and Environment. This paves way for further work to build capacity and enterprises in the bamboo sector in Nepal. 
The organisation’s Nepal office says the visit was aimed at deepening relationships with the ministry, National Planning Commission and other national agencies and understanding Nepal’s ground reality including the green growth opportunities here. 
During their stay in Kathmandu, the officials also visited the Teku waste transfer station to assess potential solutions to waste management in Nepal, and the Guhyeshwari wastewater treatment plant to understand challenges in wastewater treatment. "

The umbrella organisation of the Nepali business sector, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), says industries in the country are facing power outages for up to 16 hours a day.
For the past few days, the country has been unable to supply power to industrial factories as it has not been able to purchase sufficient electricity from India. 
Whereas Nepal produces excess electricity in the monsoon, it still has to buy from India to meet the demand in dry seasons. 
In this context, the FNCCI says the regular power outages, without any notice, have resulted in a huge loss in the country’s overall economy. Further, sudden interruptions in the supply have also damaged machines, it adds.
The federation has reminded the government and the Nepal Electricity Authority of their repeated commitments to uninterrupted supplies to the industries.
The authority says it has been unable to supply electricity to the industries as it has not been able to increase the amount of electricity to be imported from India whereas the domestic production has decreased due to a lack of rains. "

I was curious about things like the possibilities of helping these street dogs to live in peace within our society and more. With some questions in mind, I became ready to dive deep into the internet for information.
I found that Nepal has thousands of abandoned dogs, with an estimated 10,000-30,000 in Kathmandu alone. The Indian pariah dog (most common), the mountain dog, Tibetan mastiffs, Himalayan mastiff (bhote kukur) and other mixed breeds are the breeds of street dogs found in our country.
These ownerless, homeless dogs spend most of their lives on the streets and receive little to no medical attention. Yet, Nepal’s street dogs are found to be intelligent, clever, resilient, and street-savvy, and given a chance, they can become loving and loyal companions.
However, I also figured out that this ungoverned, displaced, and disregarded animal thriving their life on the streets are exposed to several human-induced threats reflecting the substandard attitude and behaviour of this 21st-century society towards these vulnerable beings.
Nevertheless, humanity is still alive and in many cases, the majority of the food for these homeless dogs comes from human donations. The prevalence of disease and injury among these street dogs is significant, and their lives are much shorter than those of pet dogs, also because of the food they have from garbage laying around in the streets of Kathmandu.  
These street dogs face problems such as malnutrition, being hit and run by vehicles, not getting medical attention, cruelty, physical abuse etc. There are many cases where the negligence of humans in regard to this animal has led their lives to the death.
Some of them are beaten badly for them trying to get closer to humans or visiting their houses in search of affection whereas some are harmed just for the peace of some evil human minds for no reason. Then, hundreds of street dogs are left to be killed on roads every year, hit by a vehicle by jagged riders; some of them are racked with the pain of wounds given by humans; some are brutally murdered as well; some die just because of deprivation of food; some become prey to humans having fun with a catapult and stone.
Governing bodies show no empathy as well because many of them are poisoned by municipalities, local bodies or community people in the name of reducing the dog population in their locality.
Every year, almost 200 people suffer rabies as a result of dog bites and this becomes a big enough reason for people to believe that street dogs are a problem, and some to the extent of believing that these misplaced canines should be killed to reduce the street dog population, while still others admit to hurling stones at dogs. While risks of rabies from street dogs are a factor to be considered, there must be more humane ways to deal with them.
I looked up to see organisations that are working in the sector and the kind of work being done. I found very few organisations speaking up for stray dogs even though there are hundreds of donors and organisations fighting for other causes.
A non-profit organisation Kathmandu Animal Treatment (KAT) Centre was established to help and protect Nepal’s street animals, particularly dogs. Its main purpose is to reduce the number of street dogs while also ensuring that those that remain are safe and healthy.
One of the members of the organisation was found saying that there are over 20,000 dogs that live in the streets of Kathmandu. They say many suffer from malnutrition, infected skin patches, parasites and other illness and injuries.
This organisation and others similar to them have aided these canines by providing rabies vaccinations, animal birth control, public education, and rescuing and treating sick hounds. Also, there are organisations working for animal welfare that have rescued thousands of street animals. To name some, there are Animal Nepal, Sneha’s Care, HART, Paaila, Aatmoutsarga Nepal, and more. 
Some also believe that because these street dogs rely on scavenging waste to live, more waste means healthier dogs and puppies. In an ironic twist, this makes their presence in society helpful for public health. They eliminate perishable waste that could otherwise be a cause of contamination for people by scavenging rubbish. 
I do not know the extent to which they contribute to the waste management problem, but I do believe that we must conserve these breeds to ensure that their kind does not become extinct from our ecosystem. But, how do we do it?  
Initial conservation steps towards their survival in a community would be establishing an animal management welfare community in the municipalities. This committee would work to link community members with their respective wards and make proper plans to feed and vaccinate the street dogs. This committee then should also provide awareness to the people in the communities while also identifying rogue dogs and transferring them to animal shelters.
The government should encourage people to pet the local breeds of dogs and discourage foreign breeds. A good animal shelter with proper facilities like veterinary care should be put in place. Population control of street dogs should be prioritised through vaccinations. These approaches can be specifically laid out in the points below:  
While street dogs do not have the luxury of a comfortable life that house pets enjoy, they are nonetheless adaptive to humans and respond to human empathy. A little empathy and respect for other animals may undoubtedly decrease a lot of strife and make our country a nicer place.
There is a saying by Mahatma Gandhi that the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated!"

Since Google Pixel 6A is the economical version of the Pixel 6 series, one cannot expect top-notch performance from the phone like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The performance of the phone is toned down but is decent enough for the price range it is being offered. This phone is also powered by Google’s own chipset, has an adaptive battery and comes out with the latest Android straight out of the box. 
Let’s get into the details of the phone.
Specifications
Google Pixel 6A has a glass front, an aluminium frame and a plastic back build. It shares a similar design seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The phone has a similar camera bar design on the back and a centre punch-hole camera on the front. There is a small change in the design of the new Pixel 6A; the cameras now lie under a single glass cover making them more noticeable. The Google branding lies in the middle of the phone, and it looks neat. The phone also has an IP67 dust/water resistant certification.
The phone weighs lightly at 178 grams and is 8.9mm thick. It is available in chalk, charcoal and sage colours.
On the front is a 6.1-inch punch-hole OLED display with a resolution of 1,080*2,400 pixels with 429 PPI density. The display supports a 60Hz refresh rate which is a bit concerning as most smartphones these days at a similar or even lower price range offer a 90Hz or even 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, it has an under-display fingerprint sensor like its siblings and gets gorilla glass 3 protection.
Google Pixel 6A features a dual-camera setup on the back. The 12.2MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.7 features dual pixel PDAF which helps in the immediate and accurate focus. The main camera is accompanied by another 12MP ultrawide lens with a FOV of 114 degrees and an LED flashlight. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter with an auto-HDR feature.
Pixel phones offer some interesting photography features which are not usually seen on other smartphones. The photography option on Google Pixel 6A includes real tone, face unblur, panorama, manual white balancing, locked folder, night sight, top shot, portrait mode, portrait light, super res zoom, motion autofocus, frequent faces, dual exposure controls, live HDR+ and cinematic pan. It also features an interesting magic eraser tool.
For the video, the main camera on Google Pixel 6A can record 4K resolution videos up to 60fps. Meanwhile, the front camera is capable of recording 1080p resolution videos at 30fps. The dual-pixel PDAF will help in the stabilisation of the videos. Some interesting videography features on the phone include 4K timelapse with stabilisation, astrophotography timelapse, 4K cinematic pan video stabilisation and 4K locked video stabilisation. The phone also offers stereo recording, speech enhancement and wind noise reduction while recording.
Google Pixel 6A runs on the latest Android 12 and is said to receive five years of security updates and at least three years of OS updates. The phone is powered by Google’s own Google Tensor (5nm) chipset while the graphical duties of the phone are handled by Mali-G78 MP20. This is the same chipset used on the flagship Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro and should give an upper hand in terms of power compared to its competitors.
Google Pixel 6A gets a single variant of 128GB internal storage coupled with 6GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There is no option of expanding the memory with an external SDcard and also the new generation of Pixel phones does not get the privilege of unlimited Google cloud storage.
Google Pixel 6A features a 4410 mAh non-removable li-po battery backup. Comparatively, this is the smallest battery backup on the Pixel 6 series. It also features the smallest fast charging system of just 18W, which too is a bit concerning while competitors are offering better battery backup and a faster charger. However, the phone features an adaptive battery feature that learns your favourite apps and saves power from those rarely used. This will allow the phone’s battery to last all day. There is also an extreme battery saver mode, which when enabled will help the battery to last for up to 72 hours.
The phone features dual sim card slots that support 5G network connectivity. For Wifi connectivity, the phone supports Wifi 6 as well as Wifi 6E. The phone is NFC-enabled and has multi-system GPS support.

In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12. 
If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected.
“The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak.
But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak. 
One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138.
In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017.
If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men.
The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017. 
While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them.
“Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.”
Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation. 
In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs.
If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having two female (one Dalit) members each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected.
Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were not enough female candidates, especially from the Dalit communities.
CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected.
Nepali Congress
Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected.
Maoists Centre
The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

New York-based Nepali artist Rai debuted with her song Khai two years ago and is known for her emotional, heart-touching and soulful music. Moreover, she is a trendsetter whereas most Nepali artists disappear after a couple of songs from the Nepali musical scenario. 
Onlinekhabar has picked up the 10 best songs of Rai that you must have on your playlist. 
Khai is Rai’s first song from her debut album, Bimbaakash, released in 2016. The music video of the song directed by Sworup Ranjit is very simple yet unique. Khai sounds like poetry and it has a very simple delivery.  
Najeek by Bartika Eam Rai is also a part of her first album Bimbaakash. This is most probably one of her greatest hits. Arranged by Diwas Gurung, it is easy on the ears. The song narrates a story of unrequited love. 
Aashaa (II) is the sixth single from Bartika Eam Rai’s full-length album, Taral, released in 2018. The song is comparatively different from Rai’s other songs which are usually accompanied by slow beats. Aashaa (II) goes through a faster beat that is generally not heard in Rai’s numbers. 
Nidari is also a song from the album, Taral.  Rai says she composed the song inspired by a lullaby. However, the song also sounds like it is written for a lover. With various other instruments, the song also has beautiful bass lines. 
Ghar, which literally means home, was written by Bartika Eam Rai when she became homesick while living in the USA. The song came out of her feeling of missing home, family and friends. Earlier, the title of the song was, Yaadharu, which means memories. The song is also from the album Taral. 
Hawaaijahaaj represents Rai’s debut album, Bimbaakash. Unlike her most songs, this one creates a joyous vibe. The song has a jolly rhythm and melody.  
Holaa, a sentimental song, was released in 2018 as part of the album, Taral. The entire song is played only on the piano. The use of only one musical instrument, the piano in the song has made the song more beautiful and meaningful. 
Akin to Holaa, Timi Ra, Ma also features only one musical instrument, the piano, in the entire song.  In this song, the singer asks her lover how much he longed for her in her absence. Likewise, she also makes assumptions about how her lover would be living being far from her. 
Samjhana (Ma) is the third single from Bartika Eam Rai’s EP, Si/Ma- [Na]. The music video of this song is very interesting. It features the compiled clip of different events that feature the general people. The music video has given space to people from different walks. 
The makers of the music video made an open call asking for submissions for this video montage. The clips have been chosen as applicable to the guidelines and space in the video. 
The music video of Umer directed by Barkha Mukhia —Bayomi and Nhooja Tuladhar is very emotional. The protagonist in the music video misses his daughter who is no longer with him. In the music video, he is seen looking at his late daughter’s accessories and being nostalgic. "

Nepal has started exporting electricity that could not be consumed due to an increase in power generation to India.
According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, electricity generated from Trishuli and Devighat hydropower plants will be exported to India. 
The authority joined the energy exchange market of India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited last year.
Electricity for each block is sold at different prices. India has set a limit of INR 12 per unit. Accordingly, Nepal will get a maximum price of INR 12 per block. On average, electricity will be sold at Rs 6.28 per unit, says the authority spokesperson Suresh Bahadur Bhattarai. 
According to Bhattarai, technical preparations are being made for the sale of electricity from Kaligandaki A Hydropower Project to India.
The authority has also called for tenders to sell the surplus electricity produced in Nepal during the monsoon at competitive rates to India. Proposals have been sought from Indian companies for the sale of 200 MW of electricity generated from hydropower projects in Nepal.
Nepal has received approval to sell up to 364 MW of electricity in the Indian market. Of that, 200 MW is planned to be sold to the highest bidder. The remaining electricity is planned to be sold at the Indian Energy Exchange.
India has given approval to NEA for sale in the Indian market considering the electricity generated from six power plants in Nepal as a source. The electricity stored in the country will be exported through Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 KV inter-country transmission line.
Nepal has received approval to export 364 MW of electricity generated from NEA-owned Trishuli, Devighat, Kaligandaki ‘A’, Madhyamryangdi, Marsyangdi and private sector Giran Ventures Liko Likhu-4."

The Kathmandu District Court has quashed an earlier interim order allowing the Batas Organization to operate a hotel at a Pashupati dharamsala.
A bench of Judge Binod Kumar Pokhrel on Wednesday quashed the interim order passed by the Kathmandu District Court in favour of Batas Group on April 9.
The Pashupati Area Development Trust, the government authority governing the religious Pashupati area, has padlocked the Hotel Anand, a hotel operated by Batas Organization at a property owned by the trust.
The trust had terminated the contract that allowed the business conglomerate to operate the hotel there, but the company did not accept it and moved to court.
Hearing the petition filed by the Pashupati Area Development Fund against the interim order, the bench of Judge Pokharel quashed the interim order saying that it was not in accordance with the law to allow the hotel to operate again as the agreement between the fund and Batas Organization had been breached.
With this order, the door for Batas Organization to run a hotel in Pashupati Dharamsala has closed."
